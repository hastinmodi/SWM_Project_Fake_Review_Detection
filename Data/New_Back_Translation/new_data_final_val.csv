Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Censorship and moral code took the bite out of screwball comedy a the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such director a Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found way to revive the genre in very high style. Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed. There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concern the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who loos considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for it time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest element of the film, and the movie a a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake. Everything move along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performance from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE doe not give up all her secret in one whack. The story and performance bear up under repeated viewings. Comedy fan will enjoy it again and again!",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"So-so. That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection. As far a adventure goes, it wa great. Although, the ""quest"" wa resolved way too easily. All the sudden it wa just over, which wa highly unsatisfying. The two main character fell in love too easily. Almost a love of convenience, in fact. There could've been so much more. At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears. Even the steamy part were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even. If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This wa a pain to assemble (you need strong thumb to force the clip onto the wires), but so very worth it! A friend bought me this a a gift, and the shelf are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat bed fit easily on them. In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating a the ultimate cat tree. I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cat spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily. I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toy to the top so that they can play in there a well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge. I have 7 cat and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to. Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use. Clips were changed between original instruction and shipping, there were updated instruction in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumb to get them clicked into place. And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy. I am using nylon slip tie to help tighten that up since I have cat who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers. Would I recommend this cage? Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cage in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match.",1,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed wa that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their head very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on a soon a he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmick that may or may not have healing power or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pup don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS! In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five star is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it work despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better.",1,4

The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return. I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there wa nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away. Even though this craft maker claim there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me. Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line. I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament.",0,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is exactly what I wanted. I wa looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed ha a headboard but no side rail or foot board. I've been using a dust ruffle for year and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, wa very aggravating. Especially since my toddler grandson nap in this bed at least twice a week. I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blanket in. The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffle or on bed with side rail and foot board. I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge run across the width of the bed instead of the length of it. Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it wa intended, this work just great. The spread is top quality. After making sure it wa the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed. It's just perfect and washed beautifully. No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching. This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow sham (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did. My toddler's bed look great and will be easy to make a he get in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it come in other color so I can order another one for change of seasons.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This camera bag is great! If you have a mirror-less set up it would be ideal. For a regular sized DSLR maybe not so much. I bought this to replace my AW150 slingshot, which a a big guy...is a horrible backpack. I really like this backpack, but the camera compartment is too cramped. I will be returning it and getting the larger version for the extra camera room. Pros: -You can definitely fit a 11"" Macbook Air and an Ipad (at the same time) in the front compartment, there are two separate pockets. -Side pocket are super nice for a bottle. -The removable camera compartment make it a fully usable backpack. -It come with a bunch of Velcro insert for the camera compartment so you can configure it how you want. -The waist strap is big. easily over 50"" when fully extended. The chest strap too is pretty generous Cons -The camera compartment is small. It can hold my DSLR (Old T3i with 18-55 kit lens)) and barely a 55-250 lens. The camera wouldn't fit at all with the larger lens attached. -If anything protrudes even slightly above the top of the camera compartment you can feel it in your back. -The side pouch are pretty useless a a tripod holder. If there wasn't a larger version available I would keep the bag, it is super comfy. But there is, so I'm going to give that a try",1,4

Then, after a number of months, the machine started to stop after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wa not loaded: I could use it for a few seconds, have stopped it, play game with the unit, get it to spin for about 20-30 seconds, have stopped it, play more games, and so on to get the whole 5-6 minute out of it.",0,4

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief. I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David say a lot of thing quietly). My main issue is a follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feel like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discus what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the character much and they come off a cold. This novella get two star based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect piece of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them a one full length book than sit through snippet like this. I'd very much recommend that other reader do the same.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"3 star is a little harsh - but I only gave the Royal Albert Hall one 4 star and I liked it better than this, so I've got to go one less. Why? Like on RAH, the guest were a total distraction. Unlike some reviewer here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings. My negative reaction to her is nearly a strong a my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound. Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guest on RAH - old great that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa. Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guest and still feel like you got your money's worth. Joe and the boy are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star review here. Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition. I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that wa the highlight for me on Black Rock. I wa delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him. But that tee up my recommendation. RAH is better than this for the musical selection but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one. Joe really shine in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues.",0,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am a writer, and the room where I work is always colder in winter than the rest of the house. I got tired of wrapping myself up like a Christmas present in order to keep warm while working. Heat Storm to the rescue! Pros: Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally. LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low) Comes pre-set at 70F, but the setting can be easily adjusted Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far) Best of all, it doe indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently. The manufacturer say it will heat up to 1000 square feet. My room is larger than that, and it heat the area just fine. Update: The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six foot away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely. Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions): ""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat wave heat the body and object of the room directly. The heat stay evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heater heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heat you."" Cons: None so far I have only had this heater for a short time, so it long-term durability is still unknown. Very happy with this product so far!",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The mystery in this book wa a decent and solid a any in the series, but I found it overshadowed by Hamish's bizarre decision when it came to women. Granted, he's never been particularly successful, but at this point it's been drawn out so far it's becoming painful. In this case a part of it wa necessary to the plot, but it still had me cringing to read it. I think this is the part of Hamish's personality that I have difficulty pinning down, despite having read most of the book in the series. Perhaps watching the BBC television series further muddled the waters, because the character there wa slightly different than the man I envisioned through reading the books. His attitude towards woman and relationship seems slightly off (not in any bad way, but in a 'sometimes old fashioned' and 'sometimes suddenly very modern' way) and it throw the character out of balance. In truth, I'd prefer the series much more if the love life aspect wa dropped more by the wayside. There have been some book where it wa merely an aside mentioned, and I wish more were that way. Because the series ha gone on for so long, and we've gotten to know some of the character so well, it's in danger of slipping more into a soap opera than a set of neat, tidy little mysteries. Compared to some of the other book in the series, this one wa a little lacking. However, compared to a lot of other mystery series, it wa still fairly decent. I'd say dedicated fan of the series should definitely read it, but newcomer really should start at the beginning to really understand the dynamic of the relationships. AUDIOBOOK NOTE: The audiobooks in the series have all been spectacularly done, and this is no exception. The accent and voice are top-notch, the reading style is smooth and easy to listen to. Highly recommended a an audiobook.",1,4

They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who need these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin strap and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachment that attached to hose..younger reader will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed a the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to.",0,4

Our heroine, Emma, really see him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot!

Without giving too much away, the mirror are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is and isn't.

Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer block when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a good dog-seat solution. PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fit perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper strap are attached to the frame halfway along the side wall and not at the very front mean that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in). The clip attache to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable. CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog fall against the side of the box or want to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clip onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply come out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"No historian cover financial subject a well a Ron Chernow. This book on Hamilton, a well a his previous effort on John Rockefeller (Titan) and JP Morgan (The House of Morgan) are thoroughly researched, clearly written and offer entertaining reading, despite covering complicated topics. One reviewer suggested that Chernow wa more comfortable in the 19th century than the 18th and I suppose that is true. But this book, in my view, is superior to Titan. In Titan, I felt Chernow wa to some extent a slave to chronology. He seemed determined to devote about a chapter to every period of Rockefeller's life. When Rockefeller retired in his 40s, Titan lost a lot of it focus. Rockefeller lived to be 90, and I felt a lot of the second half of that book wa padding. With Hamilton a a subject, there wa no way for the author to fall into that trap again. Hamilton's origin and youth in St. Croix are still shrouded in mystery, and, not to spoil the ending, but I assume most reader are aware of Hamilton's rather sudden demise at the age of 49. That of course wa too bad for Hamilton, but it make for a more exciting book. We see Hamilton a a grown man and soldier in the American Revolution by chapter three and then leading an eventful live that make for a lively biography, when the author is up to the task. As Chernow most certainly is. This book took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what is next for Mr. Chernow, but I actually wa expecting, after Rockefeller and Morgan that he would do a biography of Carneige.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Review of: ""What Paul Meant"" By: Garry Wills Paul wa the first letter writer of Christianity. His epistle are considered the most pessimistic writing of the early church. Despite the pessimism of Paul's epistles, he guided the early church and aided the growth of the early church. The author, Garry Wills, call the growth of the early church an explosion of belief. He say of Paul: ""Paul wa part of this explosion of belief."" Garry Wills say that Nietzsche called Paul the ""dysangelist"" or the bad news bearer, and ""a man with a genius for hatred."" This is in contrast to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the ""evangelists"" or the good news bearers. The author asks the question: ""how much of this notoriety is deserved?"" His answer: ""very little."" This book us seven of Paul's letters: ""Letter to the Thessalonians"", ""Letter to the Galatians"", ""Letter to the Philippians"", ""Letter to Philemon"", ""First Letter to the Corinthians"", ""Second Letter to the Corinthians"" and ""Letter to the Romans."" These are the letter whose authorship is not disputed. Author Wills show that Paul echoed and amplified the message of love spoken by Jesus. Paul had the same message of love a Matthew, Mark, Luke and John when he report on the teaching of Jesus. This book also give detail of the life of Paul and of the history of early Christianity.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This wa one of the best book I have read this year. Not only is I Let You Go a fast paced physiological thriller it's also a intimate portrail of tragedy, loss, survival, and emotional undoing. Jenna is a young woman struggling to survive after a very traumatic accident. Im exhausted but I don't dare close my eyes. When I sleep Im assaulted by the sight and sound of the accident; by the knowledge that had I been just a few minute earlier, it would never have happened Jenna feel responsible for the tragedy and won't allow herself to find joy in anything a she feel she doesn't deserve it. She move to a small town in Welsh to try and put her life back together. While there she is withdrawn from everyone and everything. Eventually she find a small amount of happiness in taking photographs. About half way through the book their is a major twist that I for one did not see coming. The author portrays Jenna in such a way that you actually feel like you are in the book with her. The book is a devastatingly real look at how tremendous tragedy and guilt can affect every aspect of one life to the point it can be debilitating. I could say more but I don't want to give anything away. This story is so much more than a physiological thriller and I recommend everyone read it.",1,4

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it wa clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge size to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash. I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fit after it's been washed. So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it wa good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrink it'll be fine), the sleeve were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL. So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect. Which means, once washed, these sleeve will be far too short. Actually, I bet these *are* sleeve for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves. I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be? Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nub for arms? I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality.",0,4

I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick sock make sense. They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pair of regular weight socks.

It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teach countless lesson in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguise them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villager who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up a an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their life changed, and they thought le about vengeance and more about harmony.

Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance. This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :) The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turn it into an incredible novel!! She superbly snake around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scene into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go. Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It mean we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunk of world &/or character building. I absolutely cannot wait for the next two booka.",1,4

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"There are many option out there for small aquariums. So many questions. Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter.... As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tank and took a 10-year hiatus. In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish? A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha). We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive! We purchased this Eclipse tank because it wa seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leak on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually make the tank appear bigger than it is. I have seen comment that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back. The tank is quiet and stay very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish. We do a 25% water change every 5-6 week and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 week (or whenever needed). Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again). I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setup available for le than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top. This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",1,4

It's cool because it fit in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances.

It actually track surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayak for sure.

Comply tip had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eye detracts from the value of them.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the look of it. Tapered front fit under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice. I don't care for some bag out there that have all kind of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy! Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons. One, it's a little pricey. Forty buck is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike. And secondly the design of how the top open up could be better. The top is held closed by two zipper down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front. The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it. And then the zipper are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zipper at the same time. In theory this sound good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either. I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zipper together. This help quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open. IF the zipper opened from the rear, and the velcro closure wa across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty buck wa too much for it.",1,4

Within 6 month of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with wa starting to yellow and deteriorate.

I have only been using the tape for two months, but at this point I couldn't be happier with the product. In fact, I just ordered more to put on my cyclocross bike. The extra thickness of the DSP tape help make rough road more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves.

This time he ha written a more personal document, starting with his experience a a Tibetan, then Zen monk, leaving the monastic life and marrying, and searching for the historical Buddha and his teachings. It is a compelling story. It is not for those who want to cling to comforting beliefs, but for those who seek liberating new perspectives. I myself have been involved with both Zen and Tibetan, and felt that their doctrine conflicted with the Buddha's teaching. Batchelor is a breath of fresh air who cannot and should not be ignored. Ignore what you are taught. The truth is in there.",1,4

The story itself is something of a departure from the standard mystery format. The serious issue facing veteran returning from war take center stage for at least the first third of the book, and, after the actual mystery kick in, Spencer-Fleming continues to pull this thread through to the end. The relationship among the character that began in earlier novel in the series are brought forward and developed further. What I enjoy most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way her character remain true to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with issue surrounding re-entry into her life a pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effect of the war in which she ha just been engaged have changed her and altered her reality. She ha the same issue a other soldier who return from combat. But Clare is a priest, and donning her collar, along with all it attendant expectations, make dealing with those issue that much more difficult. In her construction of the dialogue, the author make Clare's very human struggle apparent and sympathetic. Other writer here have reviewed the story in greater detail. A lot happens in ""One Was a Soldier."" There is significant progress in the story for all the characters, but there is plenty left on the bone for the future.

This new head allows u to visually see when the water is cold, hot and hot, it allows u to adjust a temperature that we like visually (blue color, green, red painted 3 temp ranges), ha selection of versatile spray although we basically use just the rain shower setting. Also, a giant more is the speed at which the shower warms up to temperature now - I guess this advantage is because of a better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,CG,"*I received a copy of this book a a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review. 4 star for Chicago-a shot at heart change everything by AJ Harmon. If you're looking for a sweet and healthy romance, it's the book for you! When the gentleman of the South, Alex Beaumont, meet the difficult and sweet Mia of Chicago, they don't really think they would have something in common. However, after having had dinner one night, they discover each one that they are quite attracted by each other. They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither of them ha ever been in a serious relationship. To say that they both need to experience this unconditional love and support in their life would be a huge euphemism. He will take sacrifice on both sides, but if they are willing to take risks, they could just find what ha been missing in each of their lives. AJ Harmon is an excellent motmith that brings both his character and the detail to life.",1,4

They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather. More of a spring/fall shoe. They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper. The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather. This make them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all. I deemed them to ""fit a expected"" because a a 7.5, the 8 were a little big on me. Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes. They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide). At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them. Update: I should also emphasize that the sol aren't very supportive.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog ha given u three movie - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay a unique pearl in Movie History.

Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers. NOSFERATU, shot in 1978, try to establish a link between the german director of the 1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance, author who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new generation of german director that appeared in the late sixty with such remarkable individual a Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner Herzog. Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantic with his image haunted by nostalgy, with his hero able to see what is invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU a if you're about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment something you'll never forget. Other Werner Herzog's movie will be released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream. A DVD dedicated to a lost genius.",1,4

It ha worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers. -Directions were a little tricky, a it wa in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it) The positives: -My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance. -The suction cup ha help up just fine!

It look like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon come to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master. Review - 2/5 When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the character are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it doe have it's moment that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He ha some funny one liner and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effect aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it wa made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actor or director ever becoming a big name. None of them ha made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it.

I would have loved it more if he get his own POV. But I wa stuck with Cathy, and her thought weren't that bad. There were a lot of bump before their happy ever after and there were time when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really want Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work There were time when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal they were a great bunch, and both of her friend are there to catch her every time she falls.

One more thing - the food that come out of this ha sooooooo much flavor! Any spice you use are forced into the meat because it cooked under pressure. Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Ordinary Men"" chronicle the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several unit that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other unit like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killer of the Holocaust? Author Christopher R. Browning doe a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also present a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderer of thousands. However, the book also stress that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" a they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organization from youth. Browning also doe something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, a some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicle just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all student of the Holocaust.",1,4

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Rotters is definitely a novel of unique content and fresh ideas, but the story felt more like a one-trick pony than a creative masterpiece. Kraus ha honed his chop on lesser-length work and some of the stress of a full novel show in his pacing and plotting: full bore for dozen of page and ploddingly dull for dozen more. The corporeal and detailed sub-culture of grave robber is splendidly realized, and the player are mostly intriguing if dull. Joey's experience at school and at the hand of student and teacher alike are far too over the top to be believeable in any real sense. The villain of the story go through so many self-mutilations, that he too, becomes just another unbelievable movie villain in the vein of Jason or Freddy instead of Anton Chigurh. At it condensed heart, Rotters just wasn't very interesting to me. It wa like a sideshow exhibit where at first glance, you're wowwed, but the novelty wear off quickly and boredom set in. At one point, Joey break his father's shovel handle. There is an entire monologue and a continuing story arc about how this incredible instrument had been with him for 20 year and had to be thrown away. The spade is the tool, not the handle. You wouldn't toss your favorite instrument because it needed a new shaft. You'd get a new one and keep using it. This book is the same way. The focus wa far too prevalent on the handle, and much le on the part that mattered most. On a parting note, a a parent, this is definitely not for kids.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observation are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials. I bought these specifically because my snowboard garment (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capability (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx us in the production of it garments. After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garment are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with). I have applied these to my leather shoe and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rain here and I don't wear my leather shoe during the few day it doe rain. So I can't confirm that it work well for leather shoe waterproofing. Pros: 1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes. 2)Easy application. Just spray it.

So secretly, I wa not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what wa in the future. Lots of mess. I don't mind the scooping. To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor. There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor. We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did. I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often. There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only take a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore. This thing is well-engineered: Most of the litter stay in the box. It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean. Very easy to clean. Anti-microbial without any chemical odors. Holds a boatload of litter. Tucks into a corner. Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better.

I quickly discovered that the beak earthing cable and the LED output indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a unique conductor so it wa easy enough to pin and weld an additional wire to cover the distance. The LED cable is a three-conductor cable with a socket and a receptacle. To cross the extra distance, I bought a Radio Shack-designed extension cable for use with stereo connections, etc. The faucet work well, simply and efficiently.",1,4

I purchased tektro caliper and front brake handle to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake work fine and is plenty strong. A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in. This make the reach to grab the handle less. You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjuster at the handle or at the back of the bike. The bike go together quickly and easily. Now if you want to adjust it properly a far a the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.

So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their result before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now. After using one I have mixed opinion on how useful it really is. The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge! I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several time bigger and bulkier. It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up. The partial charge took 20-30 minutes. My opinion is mixed on the charger. It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, a it's magnetic. On the down side the watch ha to be laid out flat to charge, so it take up quite a bit of room. Installing Android wear on my phone wa easy enough. The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet. I downloaded a few application from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather. It wa fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free. The weather apps are also very useful. The notification are pretty cool, but are one of the reason I question the usefulness. So little text fit on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything. Similarly, setting up Google map on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone. The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of time converting to Russian and it work pretty well. All in all I think this is kind of a niche product. The size limit the market even more, a it's huge.",1,4

Wiring involved wa all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speed downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed a when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster product (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right? Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movie wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results). One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port unit must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, a Netgear's spec for the ""XEB1004-100NAS 4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically state one unit ha one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit ha 4 ports.

Like a number of Bucks knife now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots: The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gap or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined a on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 time a much.) The bone material seems OK. The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck ha a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which us the same steel. The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pin are buffed to near invisibility. Blade pivot point: The blade snap open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and doe not ""lock."" Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice a a gift, a a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or a a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and look nice.)

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special a far a look go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirt when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me a much a my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of woman prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide a much support a my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strike a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I wa glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder strap are comfortable and the hook are strong and secure. I don't usually order bra online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it wa going to function a a house bra and I wa not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wire and feel nice and comfortable with just enough support.

I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkle which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are a follows: There may be HDCP protection issue that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, play just fine.) My computer normally run at le than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source ha caused that problem. And it wa only one time. And I have the feeling the computer run a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more. The computer ha stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver ha stopped responding and ha recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret. Again, these issue may be specific to my computer setup. I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy. Follow-up: All issue have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphic chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback us only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that us the CPU, I think).",1,4

I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowl twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.

I have 2 long-haired cat and 2 short-haired, all under a year old. The fountain ha not clogged from all the hair! It's great that it ha a filter. I clean it every week or 2 by hand. It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher. I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa. The cat have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it. It wa easy to set up. Once I figured out that the hose from the pump need to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there wa nice water movement. I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splash out. If anyone know what mat work best with this, please add that to your review. I have it in the living room and I think location is important. There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is. And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain. It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door. It's a very quiet fountain. You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound. I don't unplug it at night. It run 24/7.",1,4

I can see the twelve and one high-born maid riding forth from the Abbey the twelve and one maid who were promised a bride to the Were-riders of the Waste.

It not only brings an entirely new ergonomics to the camera (for the better) but add several more control enhancing it's professional use to say the least. But build is like Fort Knox perfection. NO gap and it's solid a a rock once installed. I prefer to use the battery access on the grip altogether than bother with removal to install in the main body. The grip is a HUGE enhancement and you always feel like it's locked in your hand allowing for lower shutter speed shooting a well. If you have a OMD ""Just Get It"" and don't look back",1,4
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have many different set of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them a pajama and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new set to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set. MediFit is one of my favorite brand for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set wa just a good a all of the other MediFit scrub that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feel light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office. This set of scrub is very roomy and it ha a flattering v-neckline. The top ha a roomy patch pocket, and the pant have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which mean it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant leg are a standard straight leg fit. The scrub have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance. I must disclose that this product wa received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion wa not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions.

She may have a slight tendency to be a mat, but all woman tend to (at least for a certain stage in their lives) put all others ahead of themselves. Yet, Gina usually doe this only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that can still deny her what he most need - a woman who will love her and accept her a he is, poverty and everything. Their struggle to escape the wound of the past and to work through their doubt and fear allows this book to be a remarkable romance that defends the power of love. Devon is the person who really change in this novel, and his emotional battle are usually the most convincing. But Gina hold her own and is the perfect spouse for him. Their back romance is afflicted with both tension and pleasure, and is fully satisfactory.

I've attached a couple of closeup below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I wa worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually ha more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup ha a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually ha some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. ) I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black v blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more setting without concern. But apart from that, I love it. It's very regal. I feel like I should invite the Queen over for a spot of tea. ---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review.",1,4

The only negative thing I have to say is that I've had le than 2 year and I had to change the battery once but I think it's working since before I bought it so it's a minor complaint.,1,4

He seems chronically grumpy mainly because he ha to to put up with ""nancy boy"" Mike Greenberg. For his next career Greenie want to be baseball commissioner. He ha some new rule for the game that make sense: more day game & bring back double header which would in turn shorten the season so they wouldn't have to play outside in November in Minneapolis or New York or Boston. Some make no sense. No soup will be served in any ball park. Bring back the trough in the men's rooms, like in Wrigley field. Ah, tradition. They talk about the unwritten rule of baseball. They are moronic, numerous & a old a the game. I love them & woe be to the player that break them. Other sport are covered too. The ""sheets of integrity"" for ""March Madness"" college basketball is classic. Golic ha no integrity when it come picking his 64 teams. They have an annual wager that is a highlight & ha included in the past Greenie milking a cow on live & Golic getting his rather hairy body waxed.

Yes, they are a little thin but I wa only putting cable into mostly internal wall space and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables! I found no problem with the brass ferrule and not once did I have any issue with the end breaking off but remember I wa only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra flexibility wa really helpful. I wa using only two or three at a time.

Kai Mexr wa Commander Rehzs right hand man and wa supposed to retire when his last mission ended, but he wa forced to come back a a trainer for another mission. His new trainee is Aled Price another person with human genetics and stubborn streak a mile wide. Kai and Aled butt head from the very beginning, but realize that they need each other to survive. They have to deal with the harsh reality of training, and when that is over, the treatment at the hand of the Ungrich. Palk set his sight on Kai and his trainee and make sure his presence is felt to both men. Aled realizes that Kai doesnt believe he deserves better than being taken roughly and without any choice in how he is taken, but trying to make Kai see that he deserves more may be battle too big for Aled. We see Anna and Rehz in this book a well since the Ungrich seem to have set their sight on human DNA. Both pair realize that if their secret is not protected then they will be target for the military to use them. When Aled go in to get his medical clearance and to finally be free to pursue a life with Kai, he is taken for the Ungrich, a is Anna. Both Kai and Rehz now need to join force and go rescue their mates. This book end on a cliffhanger. I give this book 4 stars!",1,4

However, I am not sure ALL murderer have had a bad upbringing where they were whipped or even abused. I am sure there are case where this is not so. It would be interesting to examine more case especially here in America. I wa raised by a half German and half English mom and wa not abused much. I turned out to be a happy and productive person. I do not blame my mom for her abuse which were there but nobody is perfect and she grew up with the threat of the strap herself. I do not see the purpose in blaming parent except in the case described in the book. To me I wonder if it is more of a German problem but I am probably nave to think that. As stated in the book it is not limited to just one country. I know from the parenting book out now (since I am a parent to two girl myself) in America the opposite is the case. It is a fear to even raise a hand to a child because of the consequences. Which is good. My sister ha perfectly mannered child who have never been harmed physically and I hope emotionally a well.

I think he's the biggest actor who work today but some of his recent film I wasn't a big fan of. He wa great in The Humbled but I thought the film wa a little slow.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"As a stand-alone book, The Long Earth take it time getting started, which may put off Pratchett's usual audience. The thing is, it's not a stand-alone. It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random event and character and why the ending feel so odd: it's not really the end. The Long Earth is equal part SF and real (and very hardcore) science, with a huge number of callback to Sir Pterry's Science of Discworld books. Pratchett and Baxter's world-building is outstanding, believable, and meticulous. Well, aside from the steampunk airship. The humour is far more subtle than most of Pratchett's other work; more like Nation than the Discworld novels. Like Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, The Long Earth ha a vaguely hallucinatory feel. This may be intentional, or a symptom of the Embuggerance. For all that, it's a relatively quick and easy read. If you're unsure about buying it, you may want to borrow a copy from a friend.",1,4

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old love it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for a long a we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for a long a we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his leg go thru, and sometimes even lean backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toy to the side where the canopy snap on/off. He really love the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hand to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!",1,4

I have no clue what broke it. The second one worked for a minute or so and then did the same. So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness ha worn off. For the money... I have found better spot weld bit and will most likely not reorder these a they definitely don't last a I expected. Sorry, but fact are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bit were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The thread are common right handed thread so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turn when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place. Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it need to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge.",0,4

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak wa removed, the instruction would fit on a single sheet of paper. I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table insert at the center of the cutting surface.

At the same time, for a good part of his life, he wa often sarcastic, hot head and abusive, especially when he wa drinking.

However, the scale wa misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and wa told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tool with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem a you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly.

Books_5,5.0,CG,"It's a book you want to read again. It's complex and ambiguous, so it take time to think about the clue and find theory about exactly what happened and what it means. I'll say that the first novel in the book is a very strong, intriguing beginning. The second novel describes an alien society. It's probably a bit perplexed about the first reading, but it's still an entertaining reading and you'll get at least the overall picture. I would recommend this book to any serious reader of science fiction, or any serious reader who like science fiction on occasion. If you don't like science fiction, you could have a knee reaction to the book just because of it kind. I'd recommend first of all Wolfe's ""book of the new sun"", but it's still a great work that deserves a 5 by itself.",1,4

He wa ordained and became a professional protestor, I do not remember that he performed many priestly tasks, but he certainly made a lot of protest against the Vietnam war.

This end up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air get in the house. Compare that to the amount of air that come in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside. Here is the drawback. My dog love to grab shoe and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard. I have to go out regularly to pick up the thing they drag out there. I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig hole in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom. I also close the door occasionally so the dog won't bark at neighbors.

Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it doe not have mm, cm or inch it just tell you how much notch to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feel quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it look just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accent set the face off adn compliment the clasp.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Two Heart. One Hope. This series is so great! Melanie Dickerson's Fairy tale retelling story mix romance, history, and adventure together. The first book is The Healer's Apprentice. The adaption of Sleeping Beauty. Rose ha been appointed a a healer apprentice at Hagenheim Castle. A rare opportunity for a wood-cutters daughter like her. While she often feel uneasy at the sight of blood. Rose is determined to prove herself capable. Future will mean returning home to marry the aging bachelor her mother ha chosen for her a bloated, disgusting merchant who make Rose feel ill. When Lord Hamlin, the future duck, is injured, it is Rose who must tend to him. As she work to heal his wound, she begin to understand emotion shes never felt before and wonder if he feel the same. But falling in love is forbidden, a Lord Hamlin is betrothed to a mysterious young woman in hiding. As Roses life spin toward confusion. She must take the first step in a journey to discover her own destiny. Although Rose is not a courage a the other book heroines, shes more a bit old fashion compare to other character in other book(perhapsI guess only a little) Bur she ha her advantages, shes kind, she try her best to help her friends, and full of responsibility. She knew she cant be with Lord Hamlin because of the betrothed, so she decided to sacrificed her own happiness rather the good of Hagenheim. Besides all of that, shes a story teller!! How interesting! So for those who concern the shallow characters, I think it better to consider this book a a beautiful fairy tale rather than a contemporary novel. (the book itself is based on the Medieval term, sojust think read the book a Romeo and Juliet, but with happy ending. ) Forget the plot about a damsel in distress, youll find yourselves enjoyed a gorgeous romance story.

The progression of the sexual tension is also incredibly exciting, even when it's one sided. That is an astounding accomplishment on it own. The author created amazing chemistry between Kaiden and Serena right from the beginning. I realize now that part of that wa due to what a unique character Serena wa and how fascinated he wa by her. Unfortunately, Serena later loses her uniqueness and becomes a regular girl in love. Considering the physical prowess she displayed in the first part of the story, I wa expecting her to become an amazing athlete or to do something extraordinary.

After finishing the book and then listening to the commentary by Santoro, I am shocked by the total inaccuracy of his commentary. It wa like returning to the1940 USA propoganda about Germany. Great movie but almost everything about the commentary (which must be turned on) is a fiction. Germany before and during WWII wa not a cartoon character, and serious study must be undertaken to understand Prussia and Germany. If USA citizen knew the history of the German States their attitude towards Germany would change dramatically.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but wa disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops.

Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees. What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it wa after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it ha been brewed not 30 minute or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee. A few minor point include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

I exchanged the tool for another, selected by hand from the inventory, and found a fair.1 degree misalignment after looking at about a dozen. This is an operational precision but the IMO tool should be engraved, and the scale should be exact or the scale should be eliminated.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same a it wa when YOU were a kid. Newsflash! Neither are today's kids. I understand that people are sceptical of tie-in with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That ha always been around. I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not a high quality a it should be. However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewer here. I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parent or reviewers. I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think. Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 month to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER! It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children. Reading to a child in that age range make book something which will then be loved far more than if a child just look at book by him or her self. It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter. Play with your child when you offer your child the toy. There is lot to do with it! We like it very much. I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring. I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading! Mom of five son here! :) jean",1,4

They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bump (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage. Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike a it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break. The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photo to see what I am referring to. If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I wa going to mount it on my handlebar bar end but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and it cable. For street only bike use with noted size issue.

At time this book brought me to my knee because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand.

Quinn is a kid that ha a mother who doesn't want her, she throw her out at 15. She ha to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the street is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few option in survival, drug to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She make her choice and it is neither. She meet Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meet Quinn he fight enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demon are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran a far away a possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and doe best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

If you consider this game for a fun evening game with friends, it will not be a great choice. It take a few hour to learn the basic rules, then some game to understand the mechanisms, and then hundred of hour to fully grasp the potential of bridge building in the universe.

On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one... While the narration performance wa expectedly funny and entertaining (Short doe a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well a of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moment captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man ha the memory of an elephant because he wa able to recall event and moment in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it wa truly astonishing. These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoir have become my favorite thing to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and detail of thing I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers. If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it. RATING: A-/B+ (4 stars)",1,4

As far a sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eye or bumping ugli like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing le than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there. Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural. Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline wa good but too much wa happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario wa thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situation needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I'm folding the top down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher sock for protection against insect bites. For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy. Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good! Construction: You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness. There's a ribbed band that go completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toe and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside. So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable. You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the sock too hot or bulky. Materials: With year of experience knitting sock myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers. These sock exceed that, and should wear very well. These are my favorite store-bought sock yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf. You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

Twyla is all clear of the moon and shadow - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite burple color (which according to her is blue mixed with purple). Twyla the skin is a very light purple that gradually turn into smoky grey on her forearm and hands. She ha silver smoke pattern that start at her ankle and reach her calves. Twyla ha purple eyes, pink icing lip and cute little pit at the edge of her mouth. I love her bright mint green hair and long white robe and her long green hair with bud stripes. As others have mentioned, one fun thing about Twyla is that white shine in the dark color.",1,4

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8 So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer. ----------------Old Review---------------- I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable: If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below. If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows. So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",1,4

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on. Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toe is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose. Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly. Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it wa slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect. But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issue I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling. I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my foot hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issue (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my sol is preicous, and when my upperfoot ache (the bones), having le constriction a this style provides helps.

So often they are tight fitting, so I wa happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band. I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but review said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sport bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute. The color wa exactly how it looked in the picture. I am glad I opted for the medium cause this doe appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it make it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat. This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That wa really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair tie that you can only use once. I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pant and still look great.

It add just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercise on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knee or back being in pain. It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it. It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your foot that you won't slip on it. The mat itself look really nice. I bought it in black and it ha a nice textured look to it that feel great when you lay on it There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it. If it doe get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple. The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor. It measure 24"" x 72"".

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that wa Allegiant, which wa in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book wa available for free at my library and the other book I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short story is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the story themselves, knowing the truth behind everything a revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I wa forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these story for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the story were just okay. While we do learn some new detail about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which cover a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it wa just. okay. Altogether the collection wa a three-star read. There wa nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately.

Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I bought one of these unit in 2008 when I saw one on the news. I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon. When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level wa 6.0. The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon. I called to have a radon removal system installed. Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low. Now for the problem. It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 year but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0. Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1. Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2. Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show wa two dashes. I think it got fried little by little. But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time. At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated. That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one. Update: The day after I wrote the above. Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs. Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.

It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere. I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these. Wrong. It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really make everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that make the Reveal bulb so good. Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these. I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal. In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable. These are nowhere near a hot and should save me in the end in regard to power bills. Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulb were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb. These seem very focused at 45 degree so the kitchen doesn't seem quite a bright a with the halogens. Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",0,4

There are advisory note from the author: If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive event in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path: If you have been abused, the same applies Its interesting to me that she ha not written this for a therapy a most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark place this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She say how the book ha not been edited and re edited so a to take the meaning and exact happening out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written a a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, it a learning curve, it a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I needed a new headlamp to replace one from a big box store which broke easily. I chose this one because it ha a separate switch for the red light. I am an amateur astronomer, and I use a red light when I am observing to protect my night vision when reading star map and eyepiece focal lengths. It take about 30 min for your eye to become dark-adapted, and thus able to see very faint deep sky objects. A flash of white light ruin night vision for another 20-30 mins, and my previous headlamp had to cycle through 3 white light setting just to get to red, and this wa a nuisance to me and anyone who wa observing with me. THIS headlamp allows me to switch on the red light without any possibility of turning on the white light, and I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife. Enough about red light, now I'll tell you what I like about the white light. I had to do some work in the attic, and I used this headlamp to see what I wa doing in the dark attic. It start of with the brightest white light setting at first one when you press the white light switch. If you quickly press the switch again it go to a dimmer setting for longer battery life if you're going to have it on for an extended period. There are 3 brightness level which can be accessed by pressing the switch again within about 5 seconds. I am very pleased to tell you that you don't have to cycle through all these brightness level to turn it off, because after being on in any brightness mode for more than 5 second result in it simply switching off with ONE press of the switch.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This ha to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bra I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only ha good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the need of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The strap are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing dig in leaving those red strap mark on your shoulder at the end of the day. The underwire supported cup of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accent are very feminine. Nothing show through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this wa a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"The music is, a expected, brilliant. The set and cinematography are magnificient. Adrien Brody, a usual, put in an excellent performance---he ha probably the most expressive eye in cinema. The script is also solid, few dead spot anywhere. What keep this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline a a director, or apparently the lack of strong producer willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lot of fat! At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice a long a ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hour and cover a much wider scope! It take forever to depict a few simple scene (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and character (such a Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw). I get the impression that Polanski wa given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself wa a Holocaust survivor. The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film ha almost no recognizable subtext. It's been promoted a a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feel more like a very slow documentary. Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly center around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps. Brody's character seems le of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of event after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts. Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lack any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum. The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH thing happpening, but are never made a PART of them.",0,4

You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing. Cons: it's tight, not a tight from the stomach a I would like. I did read some reviewer left this comment a well. It doesn't hurt from the torso a others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line help it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll. Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good. BIGGEST Q&A: What the heck is the bottom opening for? It is too overlapping and small to be used for the restroom..unless you're a male, don't even think about it because I'm sure you're bound to get your hand dirty..so -1 for that!",1,4

The VCR also doe not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model. My advice is this: If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.

Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal play a doctor who care more about helping his patient get well than he doe getting paid, not just because he give both the government official and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American tradition and healing method play in this film. Maybe for all those things. Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it add a dimension to his character that make this more than just an action movie.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I am a big fan of book on the history of science and technology. This book is a valuable addition to my collection. In this book, the author make a good argument for the screwdriver being the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. It seems like such a simple invention, yet he demonstrates via good research the importance and discovery of the screwdriver. He make a less-well researched claim to the history of the screw. Many tool that we commonly use are much more ancient than the last millennium-the hammer, axe, plane, and so forth are ancient tools, well developed in Roman times. Yet the screw and screwdriver, essential today, are fairly new, developed during the late middle age or early renaissance periods. One of the best part of the book is chapter 5, where not only reveals the 'first' screwdriver, but information on Henry Maudslay, Jesse Ramsden. Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, Richard Roberts, and James Nasmyth, most of whom I had never heard of before. Maudslay and this small group of mechanical genius were the people who 'invented precision' a another writer put it. In other words, this group devised the machine tool required for precision work. They are mentioned in this book because a lot of their work revolved precision screws, their use and manufacture. That's one of the thing that I like about this kind of history. One good book can lead to an area of discovery and knowledge that the reader might not know about. Since reading this book, I have become interested in the history of machine tool and their inventors. A good book, well written. Recommended. PS the title of my review contains a 'screw' pun!",1,4

I wa not familiar with the author prior to this book.

She is a talented writer. I am not familiar with camming, but would expect that she got that pretty accurately. That aspect of the book wa a nice twist. Not only doe the main character have psychotic urges, and a dark past, but because she ha locked herself up, she ha become one of the country's premier web cammers to support herself.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I know: many viewer resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the character played by Connery and Zeta-Jones. Most of them had vivid memory of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging spark with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual, and sexual ? I find the movie entertaining, a it show 2 people enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the same thing ! - but a it happens in life, people perform so much better when they really like what they do. The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's le evident, more inward quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime experience. As they go about doing and accomplishing thing together, the old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth. Slowly he start to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of his age, he feel that, to a certain extent he care for her. While, at the same time, she turn from intellectually admiring him to actually liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair and eyes, but the film offer enjoyable action moment interspersed with occasionally good dialogue and exchange between the two leads. Watch and enjoy the movie, a I did, for what it is not for what it is not !",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"""First Blood"" ha to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action film of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it doe a nice job of balancing action scene with drama. Thus, this film doe not reek of the overkill violence that plague the two sequel (as well a the film of other action stars). Stallone actually doe some acting in this film. His performance a a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the character are certainly memorable. Rambo ha a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequence only become better a the movie progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion. If you enjoy action film with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood.",1,4

It roll flat enough (a single edge held a little loop) and is easy to keep wrapped up for storage with a practical Velcro carrying the strap that envelope closely at both ends.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fan and I'm totally sold on them. The terrible builder quality fan are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year. I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple thing to note. 1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching. I realize some folk say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that. The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side). That mean cutting and patching. For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem. 2) The vent on these fan is 4"" in diameter and typical older house have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan. 3) The fan instruction tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting work just fine (my duct run le than 10' each). 4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fan (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud. Yep, the fan is that quiet. The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer. These fan are expensive. However, compared to my old fan that sound like a blender full of rock these Panasonic fan are almost undetectable when they run. If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.

When you open the case, the button often fall right out. If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strength so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

Each one also come with the attachment part so that one of the biggest BearGguy model can alternately hold hand (paws) with it if you want. As they are all the same mold, you can also exchange coin and make custom multicolors a well. Whether you use them a add-on for other model or just want to show them alone, they are really cute and very simple to build.

Ms. Reynolds ha always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him. Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe wa obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It work for them, and it worked for me while I wa reading it! I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy time between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It add the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness. My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more. I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too! *ARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review.",1,4

I've had it for about 2 weeks. and it ha been keeping the the water crystal clear! which amazed me because turtle dirty water so much so fast. So I'm pretty amazed, I'd say the water clarity ha never dropped below 90%. and I love it, This is a fantastic canister filter for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap canister, I really have nothing bad to say besides every once in a while I have to pump air out of it (I have aerator and live plant so my oxygen level are really high) And it pull the little microscopic bubble through and they build up into bigger air bubbles. And one of my plant got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake wa low flow), and the extra filter pad that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size).

In all other respects, I thought the editorial review are pretty good summary of what you will find in this book. It could have been better edited. Despite it chronological organization, there are a surprising number of place where a person or event who ha died earlier in the book pop up again. For instance, after the chapter on Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one move to a chapter that begin with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again. Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily. The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits reference too often. Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, a one would expect from an art critic. But there are only two set of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the image and sight described by the author. I often wanted to be able to compare his description to photograph of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the cover of the book. I don't know if the ebook is different but the experience of reading would really be enhanced if there were more photo located closely to what is being described or at least hyperlink to an image on the web with what is being described.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I'd never seen this movie and barely even remembered the title, so a I saw some great review I wa interested to see what I'd missed. And it wasn't much. This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brother who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch. She come to, buries her husband and swears revenge. She meet up with Robert Culp, a bounty hunter, and want him to teach her the way of the gun. He does, reluctantly, and try to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down. All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many time and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK. The 3 Stooges routine between the brother get tired fast and, a best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger. The kill scene aren't particularly clever or exciting, and not that much really happens. The way I see it the only reason for making this film wa to put a woman in the revenge seat in general and have her played by Raquel Welch in particular, and she just doesn't have the chop to pull it off. This is an oddity at best. If you're into that sort of thing then have at it. If not......skip it.",0,4

I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades. Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased). Before everything, a usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the picture of the figure in the box, or the customer image if you want to know what the figure really look like. I'll give you a hint: it look amazing. The detail is wonderful. Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure ha very good articulation too. And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt ha the classic bat emblem too. Like all the other one in the series, it come with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards. The figure is perfectly able to stand on it own, since the foot are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic. Like the other figures, this one ha no accesories. Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadget in the old series. I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray. No matter. The figure on it own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars.",1,4

I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section.

Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy suck cause you have to keep the tag on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 day regardless.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what make the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drive him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny line and situation that the theatre wa filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears. Streisand ha always been an actress of immeasurable range from musical (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit. In her semi-retirement she work very seldom. It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years. Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real character she ha ever played Stripped of glamour she wear track shoe and sneakers. She is just a regular mother who life for the happiness of her son. Rogen ha rarely played such a straight character a Andy. Anne Fletcher ha brought out the best of them both. The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience a much a Andy. . I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clip after the credit of mother and son banter that is very funny. This is a great film for parent and grown children. I wish my mother wa still alive- I'd love to take her to see it.",1,4
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We've had to switch brand multiple time when buying bully sticks. The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in. These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best one ahead of time. That wa nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones. But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer. Some brand started out this way but then started selling package were the stick were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much. I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it come from, but the dark one seem to be the best. I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or le in pretty short order, maybe 30 minute or so, then finish the entire thing later. When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces. He's a big dog at almost 70 pound though, and only water buffalo horn and bone last any length of time. I've seen many review on many bully stick wanting 'odorless' sticks. I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it doe smell a little bit.

I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real fact about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off a part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he wa not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it wa longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it make me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

The author did not commit any of the cardinal sin against the mystery form that I have run into in some recent novels. A series of odd and mysterious death occurred in San Francisco. They come to the attention of Amanda Martin, a young gamer who play with a series of young misfit and her grandfather, who raised her after her parents' divorce. Her father is a homicide detective and her mother is a Barbie-esque healer. As Amanda and her friend investigate her mother is emotionally involved with two very different men.

As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score wa something of a revelation. And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singer (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world. However: the staging is just soooo tiresome! It start off amusingly with white projection that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancer and singer coming and going through them. Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singer mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projection are going on in the background non stop. I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting. On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singer and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias. If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting. It ain't cheap.

Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it wa played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs. SUMMARY: PROS: -Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dog -Multi functional a chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well a float and what not) -kept my dog occupied when filled with treat or kibble (kibble worked best actually) -cute -squeaker isn't too loud CONS: -not indestructible for big chewer -the stupid leg (They're it's weakest point) -the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in it squeaking ability (but wa interested for food purposes) -Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",1,4

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This wa an interesting book. There were part that ran a little dry for me, a a duffer who know next to nothing about neuroscience. It wa very accessible, easy to understand and follow; if anything, the dry part were due to more depth than I needed. But it simply showed the author's careful adherence to due diligence, offering solid evidence for the conclusion she drew. The writing wa clear and professional and easy to read; there were a couple of very fun optical illusion in the early chapters, and I wish there had been more visuals, more image and graphics, for the reader's sake, but such would be unnecessary; merely fun. I wa fascinated by the concept of the book, that optimism is a necessary and beneficial adaptation in our species, provided it doesn't go too far. I am a former and still occasional optimist, of the type that went too far; I smoked for more than fifteen years, somehow managing to ignore the obvious damage I wa doing to myself, and the fact that two of my grandparent died of tobacco-influenced lung cancer. Because surely those thing wouldn't happen to young, strong me! Surely the damage that smoking doe to a person wa mitigated by my own magnificence and dumb luck! As I have aged, however -- and particularly a I have spent the last dozen year trying to teach English to American teenager in a public school -- my optimism ha decreased markedly. But it wa in some way very inspiring to me to read about the benefit of continued *reasonable* optimism, especially coming from a scientist rather than a self-help snake oil salesman.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"*I wa given a copy of this book a a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review. 4 star for Chicago-a shot to the heart change everything by AJ Harmon. If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you! When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meet the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another. They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them ha ever been in a serious relationship. To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their life would be a huge understatement. It will take sacrifice on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what ha been missing in each of their lives. AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her character and the place she writes about to life through her descriptive details. I honestly felt like I wa right there in the middle of the story alongside the character experiencing their ups and down with them. I really look forward to reading more from this author!

I quite enjoy the two character appearing in each other's cases. This is the 21st entry, but this series ha never lost it's momentum or freshness. Skillful storytelling, great characters, inventive plotting, excellent detective work and so entertaining. The Wrong Side of Goodbye wa a fantastic listen.

Klipsch didn't sound a good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component look very sturdy. There are three possible connection - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers? I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System DAV-C990 which I returned after two week because the speaker are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons: 1. The speaker cord are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote need aesthetic improvement. These speaker have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lover will adore these for their game and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality.

Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about thing not happening the same way twice. Worthless. Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tale of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many year ago who not only died but lived again and will return? Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film a it wa for me in the book. Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes? ""You're a mouse!!"" Ugh. They ruined such a great character. But there are too many complaint about this film to list them all. I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.

In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product a well a the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meet my need and whether there are any shortcoming or particular advantage in using this product. For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance ha been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectation of most buyers. With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the product of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate a outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money. Finally, a with many product of this type, the value that a consumer see is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectation were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead.

The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eye from following her movement. And in part she seems too absorbed in following her movement in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer. - The filming ha been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movement in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves. - The move are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanation for each movement a if she is careful not to give too much away. No combination of movement demonstrated. The performance part is ok, but not a good & natural a she usually is. The dvd is mostly for beginner's level and doesn't have much originality.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feel very sturdy. However I did experience some thing that I did take a star from. 1. The bolt that support the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if it worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much 2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement. 3. The leg do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the leg together? I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoff and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp.

And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the lace first. they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box wa flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boot come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long leg these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedal is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These ice pack are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our child into school after year of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwich or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either. These thin, bread size ice pack are perfect. They are le than thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included picture so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food item still fit in the container. So many of my other ice pack are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food. The ice pack stay cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food need some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top. They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get hole and leak all over. I have had way too many ice pack leak. One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack ha a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference? Pros: Thin (less than thick) Size of a slice of bread Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs. Hard plastic and do not leak Easy cleaning Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer Cons: Do not stay cold all day I wa given the ice pack for free in exchange for my opinion and review.",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I have my chain sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear. Otherwise, I touch them myself a soon a they fail to cut uniform shavings. This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwood or two hour of softwoods. If the bar get into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner. You can either carry several chain to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar. I prefer to touch up my own chain because the saw shop usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen. At that rate, a chain doe not last very long. If you touch up your own chain when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandth of an inch. This tool work well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth a described in some of the other posts. The problem is powering the grinder while in the field. Cordless grinder don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries. Corded grinder need a place to be plugged in. Either solution limit you mobility. I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge. No electricity required and it easily go in your thigh pocket or field kit.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then pick a question card from the pile and read it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All player start with 10 point each and would bet 1-3 point based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the question are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidate and how the player would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidate and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on. Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the question presented tend to be adult only (sex related).

This book certainly did not miss in the sex department. You were left with nothing le than pure satisfaction beatitude, certainly no problem there.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter. Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope. It just blasted the finish some, the scope still work fine. That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun. I seldom shoot beyond 100 yard with handgun and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags. I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x. That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it work great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need. EDIT: Well, it failed. Something apparently came loose inside. With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief ha shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view. It ha suffered through probably 5-600 round of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding. I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"". EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs. It's seriously broken, it doe NOT meet their published spec at all. Eye relief ha shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying. I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.

For an affordable skate it good and from the look of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates. So basically size is good & fit good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels.",1,4

Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.). Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system. I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal end with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inch apart in the upper back of the filter housing. Place the S hook through the hole and hang of over the lip of your tank. Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filter work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meet the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters.",0,4

I managed to put it back in place, but then it wouldn't turn. Just too much pain; I ended up trying tool from a previous vac. Oh yes, and the retractable cord doesn't work on my vac. It's a summer; but overall I still love the product.",1,4

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I really couldn't be happier with this lead. It is nice and long, so we use it tied to a stake in the yard to practice ""come"" and play fetch. I can stay hands-free and, because it's on a stake that stick out of the ground, it spin around and doesn't get tangled. The metal clip work great and is nice and strong. It ha been totally sturdy for u so far - our puppy ha reached the limit of this on numerous occasions, yet it look and feel good a new. She ha also grabbed it with her teeth any time she trip on it and no bite marks. You can't tell from the pic and I don't recall it saying in the description but, one end ha the metal clip and the other end ha a loop like a traditional leash - I just put that around our stake (which ha it's own loop at the top so it can't come off) and it stay on perfectly. We leave it out in all weather (rain, sun, wind...no snow yet) and it's still great. It is cotton so I don't know if it will break down over time but I wouldn't hesitate to replace it since it's a great price. It ha actually been a sanity saver for me since my puppy seems to love to play fetch - a 10 minute round of this tire her out enough that I can actually get thing done in my house without having to always lock her in her crate...and this lead is PERFECT for playing fetch! One of the best puppy-supply purchase I have made so far!",1,4

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quote the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calorie consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calorie between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then go on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calorie than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pound since 2006. This is a misleading example and conclusion. An increase of 570 calorie (which I highly doubt in the first place), doe not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption wa close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day. However, I do agree that these calorie study are inaccurate, but not because calorie don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which wa a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meal reported on food purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guest (who may have eaten food).

I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen. 2. I like home-birth because it feel so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, a well a myself (barring an emergency come up, obviously).

I thought I wa going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I wa pleasantly surprised! Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of u do - we make a list of why thing won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationship a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same. Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keep going back and forth between her first love and different guy before she make up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what wa wrong with the heroine. Girl on a Hot Tin Roof wa my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be!

Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco. The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather it sincerity, it concern for it characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition. Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version doe a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone. Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all. This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she get frustrated it still responds about half of the time. Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.

When she pressed her friend to try to get into the journal, it say ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of way to keep secret note from their nemesis: little brother. Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which mean it's never really secure. Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secret from her parent anyway. ;-).",1,4

When I got it, I wa initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minute on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package. Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play game with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minute out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit wa out of it (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one. That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, ha design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price.

The plot is focused on a team of tank led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy"" (immediately, when I see a war film with all the character with nicknames, I know I'm in for le realism and more Hollywoodism). There is a lot to love about this film. It's entertaining, the sound effect are impressive (LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the 50 cal shot), there's suspense, tension, and a front to innocence brought in a combat scenario. Tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screenwriter (because I mean, they're not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).",1,4

So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed. Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the character are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it wa stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past. Cavill nail Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggle to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment wa unenviable. I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series.

The dog owner, a physician, know the bone is human a 10 to 12 year-old boy. Thus begin an intriguing case that make lot of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 year before and the victim wa brutalized on a regular basis. The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy month earlier. As sharp a Harry is, he begin a relationship with her rather quickly even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship wa real; the interaction seemed wooden.

The direction clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole. Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minute of brain storming trying to interpret the directions. They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step. For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those part go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) go on left side."" Seriously. Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture look and how the description cleverly talk about it being shatter proof. It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond a a plastic backboard doe when a ball hit it. Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Best production flipper money can buy. Great execution, steel, action and aesthetics. I really enjoy the titanium frame, it ha a unique feeling. This knife needed a few day for break-in, now it's lightning fast and flip to lock 100% of the time. This is my third ZT. I'm sure it won't be my last.",1,3

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"There's a little bit of a learning curve to using this on your pet without them freaking out, I had to stitch 2 bite wound on my hand, lol. Google some youtube vids of Veterinarians technique for trimming claws/nails and you'll find a supremely easy method for gently holding your pet in place and avoid scaring them. I only wish I'd seen it FIRST before I tackled the job. We've used this several time at this point on dogs, cat and ferret and it work very well, quickly and painlessly for all involved.",1,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"To answer some negative reviews: 1. If the voltage of your battery fall below 0.89 volts, it will not turn on at all. The flashlight is not broken. Put a new battery in it. I know it's not intuitive if you're used to incandescent lamps, but it's a LED and it's the way they work. 2. Flashlight behaves erratically. It ha an emergency strobe mode that can be engaged by pressing the button halfway below.",1,3
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Attractive 100% cotton duvet cover with sham that is reasonably priced but still ha good quality. It's easy to find cheap sheet or good sheets, but getting to the perfect middle is difficult sometimes. I like the subtle design on the set, subdued but not invisible, and the feel of the cotton is very smooth, not scratchy or too tightly woven (it get very hot here in the desert and high thread count sheet don't breathe a well a the lower count). It's still too hot to use the cover with a duvet, but it serf a a nice top sheet for now.",1,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I also purchased the LU79 which I used to crosscut thin veneered Chinese Birch and it wa quiet, smooth, fast, and the cut wa perfect, no tare or splinters; I could have used it all day. It take me a little time to change blade but it is worth the time to make great cut in this plywood. It is only 1/2 inch thick but tare easily and is thin on top and very smooth. This wood can look bad with the wrong blade so I am read glad I got this 80t thin kerf blade. This is the 3rd Freud blade I have now and they cost more but your project will have a great finished look you can be proud of.",1,4
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"The worst finger paint! It's incredibly thick and fairly hard to use. But worse, it's so difficult to wash off and (at least temporarily) stained my daughter's hands! I think highly of M+D in general but they should be embarrassed by this.",0,2

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"It's hard to classify this film. I guess it's a ""drama"", but nothing particularly dramatic happens. Primarily, it's a chance to watch the interaction of personalities, mainly between the father and the two brothers. Oh, and there are some really nice landscape and fancy fishing. To enjoy this film, you have to be ready to sit down, relax, and be receptive to a slow deployment of the sub-letters of history. A bit like the way people like fishing, come to think about it. The DVD version is ideal to maximize the scenic aspect of the film - it really requires the large screen format.",1,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The diver in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person need to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter condition above the water. Wearing normal winter ski glove doesn't work because they soak through with water a you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist area and you don't tend to raise your hand up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F). I admit I wa disappointed in these glove out of the box because the seam had rough edge where they were fused together - but a long a you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all. I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hand always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these glove wa too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe. I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winter (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski glove (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hand up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mitten (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",1,4
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,CG,"I had the big rabbit toy for my Golden Retriever. It ha since been destroyed and thrown, but it wa very much loved by my dog for the squeaky sound and squeaks. This smaller version, bought for my parents' bugs, is not a big. There is no squeaky noise, just a squeak.",0,3
