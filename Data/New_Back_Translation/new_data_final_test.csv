Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Holy COW! IT WORKS!!! Nothing stick to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold! We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Truthfully, here is my story. I like Burning Man because the climate try to kill you (and other reasons.) A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!! It struck from three direction and damaged every single tent in it vicinity, toppled pop-up camper and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof. It knocked over entire row of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for day because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) wa split. My conundrum wa severe. The restoration wa going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job. I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surface and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape. I used suture and long stretch of tape to repair the split and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein. I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two week in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days. It didn't peel. It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tape will when they overheat. It just held strong. I'm in love.",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it come to science fiction novel and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"". I wa introduced to the series from a friend of mine that know I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that put you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book ha a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around u in today's society. When you get into these book you will start noticing the author ha a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the line of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series. Highly recommend the book to anyone who love sci-fi / military book or just anyone looking for a great read in general.",1,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the one I have played with. One thing to know - some tip require a stiffer frosting and some le stiff. It seems the one with the little round hole need to be le stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting color simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bag and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag help too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tip help you! Have fun!",1,4

(We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kid lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kid get cold easier!) These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which make putting it on and off much easier. A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs. The wetsuit hold up fine to this ""abuse"". My kid wear these over their regular bathing suit (including swim diaper for my 1yo). Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off. To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry. So far so good!

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem. M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly need to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" wa remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" wa absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" wa consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" wa just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I wa le than thrilled. An unknown airborne virus that drive common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivor who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I wa just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly ha it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone."" All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, wa too much money. I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan ha proven to posse by virtue of his earlier work.

I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriage and the comment on my landscape shot have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shot are surely good.' Cons- Indoor shot suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple level but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times. I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and wa impressed by it build quality. It really look cool and compact. But it turn out the price of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it ha a good chance of getting damaged. It look like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged. That moving part stopped working a few week back. It doe not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film camera bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I wa expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it ha become unusable in 4 years. I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 star but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 year of service.

In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which ha built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.) I like the way Preston ha worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy wa good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin can and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and a a contractor, I have nail gun that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellet will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellet are are also among my favorites. My only accessory were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivel myself, but that wa an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that wa it. The rifle is very accurate with it iron sight (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellet through the same hole after about 15 rounds... Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and it a proven design that ha been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just want a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 star for it design and reliability! -ONE LAST THING... Be sure to clean your gun before you fire it! -Mine had white styrofoam particle all over it and indside the barrel from the packaging. Just a friendly ""FYI"".",1,4
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and a described, so that's good. The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip. Pros: They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little nicety like a moist towelette. This make them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go. If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calorie to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories. The heater pack work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight. Cons: A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on thing you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoon are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware. Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry. Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away.",0,4

You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath. It is more comfortable in the 50 F though. I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms. Wind intrusion is not a problem. So far, the rain ha not penetrated the material either. The slash pocket are a little high up for me though. It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length. It could also be a bit more packable. I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel. Does not really lend itself to that though.",0,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility. Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser.

You eventually find a hand position that keep it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through. The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matter is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minute of running the chain in both directions. Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towel (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small link too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing. If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together.

The ankle ha the impression that it is reinforced, so if you try to fold your ankle too, it might feel weird, but it's true for many boots. If you walk one foot in front of the other (as you would if you were wearing dress shoe or on a track at a fashion show), then the clip on the inside side of the calf will hit one in the other and will probably undo -- other comment mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your foot slightly separated, it's not a problem at all.",1,4

This movie sits on my shelf because it fit all these categories. It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lie it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin line of nuance while David Norse wa achingly fragile and volatile. Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating.

If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographer and editors, the color are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use. I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone. The monitor's wide-screen real estate make editing hundred of photo quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also us le power and produce le heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis."" Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speaker are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers. With the exception of the crummy speaker and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.",1,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have several stash (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency ration and several 'bug-out' bag a I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hit the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasion to replenish my office stash a I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points: 1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect a the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bar themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper ha been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bar are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bar TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is base on 1,200 calorie per day (3 meal a day for 3 day at 2 bar per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calorie per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bar are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, doe not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergency and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: a I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catch the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even ha it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminal of my recess can which ha the gx23 connector and it wa 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it. Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess light in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wire are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing mean cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which ha the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three light just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the light and I could not notice any difference!

Honestly, the film ha a very striking, almost psycho-delicious look with a lot of wild lighting, garish and lurid colors. The edition is fast and frenetic and the visual effect are sometimes almost passable. The actor is above the top (and a lot of fun) and the script is really there.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars. ""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tool Bell us (i.e. the bit of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the event in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affair Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating.. But in the end, the constant chronological swing tired me. After loving the first 250 page of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense wa that what wa described in those last page had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent. I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide reader a better experience of his talent",0,4

The opening scene where this mysterious stranger (Django) drag this coffin into the mud and it contrast against the sentimental croonage of the opening music is, probably, one of the weirdest visuals I've ever seen in a film, leaving alone a western. There is a couple of stomach of virulent scene that I did not take in charge and the number of body is probably comparable to ""the matrix"".... I don't know what to say... It's a strange, gothic, gothic, machine-gun, spaghetti west. The addition of the caravan and the interview Franco Nero were pretty bonus.",1,4

She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room being we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only doe she benefit from this but it instantly tell me the temperature in the morning so I know what to wear. Same go with my oldest daughter. I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and show you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glow just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way. It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it last for 72 hour before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trip and voila! I am in the early stage of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already love looking at it and holding it. I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons.

I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD. Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In term of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clue amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twist a mile away, and the villain are easy to spot. The worst part wa how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrape -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dive into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained! What I assume wa the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of siren in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spur creativity, which wa not the case here. What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibit no range or subtlety. That leaf the interesting bit to supporting actor -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra a a Pakistani cab service operator.

Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for year of easier cleaning, later. 2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation. BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push button on the top of some water-efficient toilets. BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it make this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.",1,4

The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly. It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route. The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major artery and highway that you'll most likely want to use and remember. Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen setting to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.

Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fit snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that take place in 1871-1872. She also wa blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who wa an editor for 20th century literary giant like Fitzgerald and Hemingway. It wa Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'. He wa the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episode rather than hatching out intricate plots. In addition, it wa Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting wa full of tough time and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early draft of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism. Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn. He suggested that she find a more symbolic title. When she came up with title like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there wa not enough human suggestion. When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins wa satisfied that this wa the right one. Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written wa inferior & threw it out. Perkins prodded her to get going again. This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be a true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins. Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg.",1,4

She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she want to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child. There are picture on both side of the board and the board is sturdy. The animal that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some con that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the hole are NOT smooth so when the lace go through the hole, it get frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter love this and it keep her occupied for 30-45 minute at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I have had my Escort for a few weeks. I upgraded from a whistler. Right away I noticed a decrease in false alarms. This to me wa amazing a the whistler liked to go off at every turn. The alarm sound of the Escort are much le nerve racking and sound loudly at first but will then cut the volume down. Another cool thing is the smart cord. This cord ha a led only when it is plugged into the radar detector and ha another led for when it is detecting radar. Again not in an annoying way. The escort ha a dark mode which almost shuts all the led light off so a not to distract you at night but the audible will sound and the smart cord led will light up but since it is down by the cigarette lighter and not in your face it doe not distract you from the road. Overall I give this 5 star hand down compared to the radar detector I have had in the past.,1,4

(It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who ha time for that). Using the lead like this also give u a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast.

Looking back, this first book wa one of the more hilarious of the five. It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2). The best part of this book is being introduced to the wonderful cast of character that Adams ha created, especially Arthur and Marvin. If you have a sense of humor, they will make you laugh. There's not much of a plot to speak of, which is the book's major weakness. However, it is an appropriate setup to the rest of the series, and I would definitely advise everyone to at least read this initial installment before plunging into any of the other installments.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bough this when I wa living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul a the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problem with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problem would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in second if you happen to break one. I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it work just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill. You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water go off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 day depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for day out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)",1,4

Bradley writes with a tender hand about art and his history is rich with the perfume and sound of New Orleans, a city that I love, but there is a haunting sadness in this tale that is both sad and seductive. I particularly enjoyed his passage on WPA murals, a particular interest of me. Bradley's character are pleasant and entirely human and his prose is rich.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is an attractive crate. It wa easy to open and put together with just a positioning of rod and sliding of cover. Huckleberry tried it out and discovered that the zipper are ""self-healing"" zipper which mean that they can be pulled apart and then restored by sliding the tab and slider back over the separated part of the zipper. That is how Huckleberry ""opened"" the front door of the crate and met me in the living room when I returned home. He did not damage the crate but it wa disappointing. Huckleberry is comfortable in his usual crate, a metal one, and go in readily when I tell him I have to go to work so I wa surprised that he tried, successfully, to escape from this crate. We will have to work on training him to this crate to try to avoid such escape when we are traveling.",1,4
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me. I am not a power baker. I merely make the usual thing for my family and the occasional specialty items. I find it mix faster than my old stand mixer, and it take le space on my counter. Contrary to other reviewers, I find it doe cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post. MY machine came with instruction to NOT use the center addition for the smaller job like this since it produce better results, so that is how I have done it. In addition, I noticed straightaway that the direction stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minute before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricant do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noise coming from my machine. It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine. Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that wa easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common). My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she wa right. For what I use it for, I LOVE it. It is also easy to clean, the part store in the top, and it doe what I ask it to. I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blend stuff that my bullet cannot. I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ. The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blade to clean it. If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode make this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse. Animation studio with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly ha enough cash after success like the Spiderman and X-Men films. Though they tried to put in element from the brilliantly developed character in the Ultimates comic series, each scene wa rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement. That, combined with chunky animation, leaf you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters. The animation of Giant Man's growth wa unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking. Wasp's growth, having her wing disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown show a ridiculously poor understanding by the animator and director of how her power is supposed to work. Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film. Each segue wa hard and roughly paced. Camera angle were sharp and character badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized. Scenes were poorly framed. Character dialogue wa unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top. The best voice actor in the film wa Andre Ware a Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here. Marvel studio haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation. I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these character on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it. JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality. Step up to the plate, Marvel. Play time's over.",0,4

Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It put off ton of light. I wa really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon a I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on a long a there is motion in front of it.

I, along with so many others, agree that this ha been the best family series ever written - with all of the lady well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classic - With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she doe a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.

Both are job that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc. I saw this a a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said: He thought it wa a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tool he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutter and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wire or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck door or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

If you are tired of these kind of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead. What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never cease to be entertaining. Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot. So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away. But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stake of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.

They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents. The material and the fit and finish are high. Included with the headphone are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large. Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for. I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s. The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inch down from the right ear-bud. The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command. Its very intuitive and simple to use. Sound quality of the Denons is high. I listened to all type of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice. Bass wa strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered. Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound. Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I wa also able to hear subtle instrument and vocal that I would have missed otherwise. The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times. The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tip fit my average sized ear best. The headphone fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit. Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity level they should work fine. They are also light in weight.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular human exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain family are expected to obey the request of others/or stick to agreement made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rung people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ... So, yeah ... lot of questions. All of which I want answered. So I shall most definitely be reading on.",1,4

Android tablet are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile device inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device.

In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life. I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feeling between the characters. Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems a though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father. Not that she ha a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father wa replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal point out that make Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds). But the spanking are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done. The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegram to Katy's mother.

The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle system but wa shocked at the price for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this a a lift system. I wa about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer leg to a the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inch out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 foot into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"There are several choice when it come to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, ha the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pot and pan but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it ha to be cut properly. This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handle are a nice touch, but the half that touch food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to a thin an edge a is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cut on two of the utensil had left a few bit of little wood splinter that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood wa also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are area which lack the coating, and some area which appear to have blotch and extra coating. So overall, the set is ok, particularly a a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensil than this set.",0,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,This wa a pleasure to read. The amount of research the author did for this book is astounding. She didn't just take liberty on writing something in 1812 and do with it a she pleaded. She wrote a book that take place in 1812 and follows the rule of that era. Throughout the entire book everything wa astonishingly accurate and detailed. The main character wa great in that she wa consistent and stayed true to the time. Which I find greatly appreciated. And all of the side character were wonderfully done a well. I found myself pulled to a few of them and look forward to reading the next book when it come out. It's a thick and detailed book but definitely worth a read.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game doe a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass source of passive income! I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing. I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concept - and I believe it is a good introduction. The instruction are not great, good enough but not great. The instruction describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expense - but there isn't really a winner of the game. Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expense but the instruction don't state the first one to get there wins. Each player get a ""financial statement"" a their game card. During play, each player gain passive income source and expenses. The player keep track of their passive income v expense on the financial statement. When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win! The game doe a good job of reinforcing this concept and also doe a good job providing example of passive income source (rental property, owning a business, etc.). It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he need on the next turn in order to win.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This movie got SMACKED TO THE HILT by the critic - usually a sign that a movie is good. In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off a predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) come across a a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate ha an up-market jobs, a lot of the problem she face are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, bos calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleague and the like. Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film try to mock stay-at-home mothers; a if stereotyping stay-at-home mother will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, a Kate deal with a flirtatious but supportive superior. You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate find herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other character are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it wa only ever meant to be comical.",0,4

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending. The side pocket without button are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pocket are mostly useless for me. The front pocket are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of button on pockets. The button on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pocket on the side of the short I don't even use, just the smaller pocket for the cell phone. The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste. I haven't had any issue with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control wa enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel. These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy. The color wa rather darker than the picture showed a well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the short you're looking for. Belt is pretty much for display purpose only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle. They fit well though, and are comfortable.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"I had high expectation of this miniseries, given it's creation under the auspex and consultancy of Mr. King himself. It turned out to be a drawn out melodrama, full of gimmickry and with very little of the artistic panache of the original movie. The hotel itself wa attractive enough, but from there on, it went downhill. Neither the malevolent, carnivorous topiary in the garden, nor the two lame ghost plot participant did much to create a haunted atmosphere in the hotel. The hotel's creak and groan and auto-swinging door were trite and none of the character were truly convincing. Rebecca de Mornay a Wendy is alright, Jack Torrance, played here by Steven Weber is an annoying exercise in waffling, being an aggressive boozer one minute, and a pathetic whimperer the next. He never seems to be able to make up his mind who he is or what he wants, an irritatingly disjointed character who himself seems to have no idea where he is going. Consequently, the whole thing is ultimately a three hour bore. While the original movie may have had it's shortcoming in it abrupt structure of the progression of the story, it wa nevertheless far more convincing than this mushy rendition which seemed to be nothing more than the product of the mercantile mind at Warner Brothers, doing their level best to wrest additional revenue from a classic story.",0,4

MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunt will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which mean you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movie will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent film like Inception but then if you use Inception a your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movie quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that ha a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action wa really good.

I noted that other reviewer had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 mile of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently. A couple of notes. One is that the missing link wa in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chain for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm v 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident).",1,4

I didn't care at all about the color of all and I realized only after some research that there is more at the temperature of the color that make the Reveal light bulb so good.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my wife, who ride a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She wa experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bump in the road). I searched high and low for a seat that wa comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews. With the factory seat, the wife wa forced to cut ride short due to discomfort in the above stated area at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for day afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse. Seat wa installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hour after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts. We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey wa in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she wa running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors. Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it make it ride like a full suspension bike with lot of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY. Regardless, this seat work perfectly for my wife and she love it.

I've read Outlander multiple time and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love story to unbearably romantic. ""Paradox Lost"" wa a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her story have a great flow to them and this one wa no exception. I wa hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book. I had a few problem with some of the finer detail of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and wa supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it wa irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic fact about the era that he wa visiting. He kept trying to open thing voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when thing were invented. Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 year and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that. I tend to think of all of these detail when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies. Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day.

Very bland! I kept paying for the episodes, thinking that there is no way that this isn't going to get better at some point. It never does.

Although this book wa slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapter to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eye bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly. Emery, I loved her. She wa strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in way I don't think I would have been able to (as much a I would love the smokin' hot scene with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque trait made him endearing to me.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy. As charming and quirky a Gail Carrigers Soulless series, CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES delf back into all the way that society, science, and magic can collide. Sophronias perspective on manner and intelligence gathering is a fantastic window into this world, which is a interesting for the social dynamic a for the dirigible and mechanimals. From the outside, placing a spy training facility inside a Victorian finishing school would seem like an odd juxtaposition, but even new reader will quickly orient themselves to this mix of familiar historical setting and completely original world building. Sophronoia read a a genuine teenager (though historical gloss make her seem older than her 14 years), and her youth is a key element of what make her compelling a a heroine. The choice that face her are relatable, from budding love to jealous rivals, and each one of these challenge foreshadows larger life issue she will face one day. As a lady intelligencer, Sophronia is learning how to blend with society, but will she also internalize the limitation and boundary of the peer around her? Will she submerse herself in the cold, calculated, ignore-the-collateral-damage world of intelligence gathering? Or will she find a new path for herself, both professional and empathetic? While the intricacy of the mystery in CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES kept me glued to the page, it will be that larger question of Sophronias fate that will keep me coming back for more. Witty, charming, and brimming with potential, I cant wait to see the woman Sophronia is growing into.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling job for ""physique"" magazine before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several year Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol wa a bad producer, Morrissey wa a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actor to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just look so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT ha the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brother who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claim to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he get naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walk out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she give the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, add his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breast or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss.",0,4

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I would actually give mine a glowing review had it not been for one stiff wrist joint, hand broke off leaving the peg in the slot. His ankle were fine and his paint job wa good, so I'm all the more annoyed at myself (I even thought ""Gee, it would suck if I broke the wrist and got the peg stuck in the slot ...""). Aesthetically speaking, it's quite good, though they over did it a bit with the top-heavy look, true, they were pretty barrel chested with tiny leg on the show, but this is just slightly more exaggerated, it's not a deal breaker at all though. While articulated enough to get a fairly wide range of poses, it's still hampered a bit because the range of the joint is limited a bit by the bulk of the figure, only to a small degree however. The only real ""flaw"" I felt there wa with it in it own right wa the lack of a swivel joint at the hip (a two way ankle join would also have fixed this). The stand is a bit of a joke, though it serf it purpose. Due to the width of his waist it doesn't actually hold him, but it work enough to prop him up with the cape draping over it. Oh, he also come with optional capes, couldn't for the life of me figure out how to switch them. Finally, when I broke the wrist I stopped caring and yoinked the head off (I wa afraid before there wa some other trick ad pulling the head off wa requiring no small amount of effort, so ""I didn't want to break it""), that is definitely how it's meant to be done, it's a thick rubber-y plastic on a ball and socket joint (though you only get left/right movement), so I hope that clear up some head scratching.",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Benedict and Yeager describe a vast array of criminal pattern of dozen of current and former NFL player -- including some hideous and barbaric act for which certain player suffered far too little (if any!) jail time. Because of the variety and brutality of the crime described, more than the quality of the writing itself, the book is riveting reading; although there is a strongly sensationalistic, tabloid-style undercurrent to the whole piece which may repulse more careful readers. I finished this book with three outstanding impressions: 1) Far too little attention is given to the successful redemption of specific player who have stopped their criminal way and become solid, admirable citizen (e.g., ""Hollywood"" Henderson or Cris Carter); 2) The writes make a convincing argument that the pampering which star player recieve in late childhood immunizes them (in their minds) from consequence for their actions; and 3) The author clearly intended to be shocking at least a much for their own fame and fortune a for any noble social reform. After all, these criminal record are public, and were already well documented in the popular sport media.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I wa interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkle and only occasionally fall flat, usually when he get too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful description and astute retellings of every-day occurrence to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond it setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrade are interesting, but haughty, and their reason for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketch of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many character that are highlighted in their dull everyday routine just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drag down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinge on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that need to be said about that. Still, Franzen's observation on our every day life and interaction are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably ha a good grip on many facet of how our society and culture functions. Twenty year after the fact his comment are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and it blunted intricacy is not worth the time.",0,4

My favorite were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag wa the first one I owned and he still ha a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colour instead of silver, gold and gray. As much a some older TF fan like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apple and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag look like the original but ha the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelation Slug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His mode are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) look fine if a bit garish. My wife like how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people! Robot mode is where Slag fall apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head a shoulder pad instead of a helmet for example. Other part are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino leg are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot. So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectation in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking.

While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never ha before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speed and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before.

I didn't think of Bissell a a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them a making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed. PROS: It ha good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt wa in the carpet you thought wa pretty clean; It ha multiple filter that are washable, so there are no maintenance cost for bag or filters; The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush work great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that push the hair around; It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw); It's sturdy and solid for the price; It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight; It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuum I've used; The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and The canister come off and go back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied. CONS: I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaner I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way a you vacuum.

Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than just the doll. I also bought the basic accessory and a few extras. A school classroom set will add to the fun. Also, a dining room, table and chair set with miniature dish will teach the girl how to set a proper table and reinforce manners. However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurement are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curve or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mother (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters. The magic moment is when you watch your girl playing alone or with friend and see how they reflect your positive influence. That, in turn, is carried throughout a lifetime.

A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again. -------------- I dithered for month before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots. Can't say I love them...yet. Well made, but for me the styling is a little off. The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I wa looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot. Had them stretched for both length and width. And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, make a slapping noise when you walk - !! Which I personally don't care for. I guess I wa expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread. These are almost like riding boots. Have not even worn them enough to break them in.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"My late husband and I received this a a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it work great. Some other reviewer have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that. If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy. You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set. The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this work GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it wa still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater. The unit look great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

There is also a mesh basket, which you can use a a filter, but if you remove it, you can place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place. I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

Also, because of the way in which the clothes are sewn, it doe not rise far enough so that you can really put the layer around the bottom of the doll. So the diaper wa a waste too. The quality of the doll wa horrible! She seemed to be bald! If I had to start all over again, I would buy a live baby.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"At it best, this book is an amusing memoir about working a a presidential speechwriter, and a patriotic assessment of what government can do to help people. It doesn't always maintain that level though. List tell his story in roughly chronological order, but there isn't anything like a traditional dramatic arc here -- we get discussion of a good political thing, then a speech about infrastructure, a speech about correctional policy, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a bad political thing, a speech about health care, another White House Correspondents' Dinner, etc. Books by political insider can be fascinating but Litt wa not really an insider. Stories are fueled by proximity to power and to important decisions, but Litt never really got that. He share with u some funny jokes, and these are the best part of the book. A collection of his favorite Obama humor might have worked better than the book we actually got. Yes, we get the story of how Litt got his job in the White House, buffered by his assurance to the reader that he didn't really deserve the job and repeated apology for being white (starting on page 40 when he get an internship with West Wing Writers). Litt doe have some nice turn of phrase in the book; I particularly liked his judgment that the president doesn't play chess, he play whack-a-mole. Many famous people appear in cameos, including an unpleasant run-in with Harvey Weinstein that's a lot more interesting to read now than it would have been a month ago. The Republican party's weird love affair with Vladimir Putin starting in 2014 get called out a well; I suspect we'll hear more about that over time. The book is at it darkest when discussing early problem with the Affordable Care Act website. Was that really so terrible? I remember that it didn't work well, but I would have thought that the Democrats' midterm loss would have been worse, from the point of view of the White House.",1,4
Books_5,5.0,CG,"I had to hurry, a my inclination wa to inhale him in a session. The story itself is something of a deviation from the standard mystery format. The serious problem faced by veteran returning from the war take the lead for at least the first third of the book, and, after the current mystery, Spencer-Fleming continues to draw this thread at the end. The relationship between the character who started in the previous novel of the series are advanced and developed further. What I love most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way in which her character remain faithful to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with question surrounding the re-entry into her life a a pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effect of the war in which she ha just engaged have changed her reality.",1,4

You have to get an adapter to make it fit a Picitinny rail. This add unnecessary height, bulk and weight to the unit. UTG did it right by making it fit the Picitinny rail first and even threw in an adapter for a swivel sling mount if you're so inclined.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Overall this TV ha an awesome picture. White is bright brilliant white, and it almost look like a samsung panel due to it glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL. This TV wa 429, doe 1080p and ha ton of hook ups. More than most people will need. I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches. My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remote being able to control them. I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them. Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off. I have also read may post about people having this same issue. As best a I can tell at this time there are only 2 remote confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks. Thats why I knocked off 1 star. Other than that so far this TV ha been great, give good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.

The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance). The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the piece are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, give a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel. Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!) Another use for this board: if you are looking at game online (such a at itsyourturn) or studying go book to demystify some of the concept having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",1,4

This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sport romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love wa it characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of u waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there wa so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what make it character so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model wa genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio wa hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and function very well. But it show some flaw to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them. Pros: What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun. Cons: Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me) Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my gun a little bit beefier) The shells- A. They tend to jam B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really set off my inner-OCD The sling mount are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this get to be very annoying when your shell fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault. Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing. So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pro section is agreeing with most of the other review pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who want a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.",1,4

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me ha it all sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley go through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side. I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problem with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hug from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cure all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin wa able to help Riley with that. Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights.

I do wish the thermostat came with more technical detail a I still had multiple question that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service wa great in answering them. My goal in installing this unit wa to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather. It ha succeeded in doing this. It can be -10 degree out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup. It doe run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat. I like how it learns how long it take your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run time to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it. Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system a it cannot handle large swing in temperature especially in heating mode. I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away. That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.

I wa well aware of the sport guy almost pathological hatred of great Lakers such a Kareem and Kobe and I did not think he could do a book and be fair in his pyramid rating of them, nor anyone who didn`t play for the Celtics. I finally got the book and am glad I did. Simmons took plenty of shot at Kareem, but, ultimately gave him a 3rd best player ever rating. At the beginning of the book, Simmons went into great detail a to why he say Bill Russell wa a greater player than Wilt, and his argument and historical proof of his opinion wa so accurate that I have to change my own opinion ad go over to the Sports Guys side-Russ wa better than Wilt. His rating of Kobe at only the 15th best player ever wa ridiculous. With Kobe`s 4th ring won in 2009 (without Shaq to you Kobe haters) wa the final hurdle he had to get over to be rated a one of the top 7 or 8 player ever. West and Oscar won one championship each, Wilt and Kareem were the MVP`s on the team that they did win their one ring on, and Kobe ha won 4 and, yet, Simmons rate him behind both of them? Laughable. No sport place a higher premium on the all time status of player being based on championship won than pro basketball. With that truth, Bird with 3 rings, rated way higher than Kobe with his 4. Well, thats just the Celtic bias coming through since Simmons make quite clear he think the sun set on Bird`s rear end. Oh well, basically the book wa fair, it wa funny , it wa worth 700 page and would be a nice addition to any basketball fan library.",1,4

Enter a really fast and quick relationship followed by prego ex-girlfriend and a bunch of mess. I wanted to smack the hell out of the main characters. Sean didn't learn anything from the first book. He wa still a complete doofus. Scarlet wa even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it wa for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six month later, would have been the better choice. As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

I really felt the story a a whole wa just incredibly boring and instead of smart, courageous woman we get bratty, careless teenage girl trying to rebel. The dialogue did not reflect adult conversation at all. Plus all 3 book are boring, the thing is these could really be great story if some effort wa put into it. Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the story even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author need to write adult woman into the role not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girl at that.

Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wear out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler ha been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz let me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion. For me it seems it make the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time. There are a few drawback though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dish then this may not be for you.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There are two thing that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film star Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offer little more than familiar scare and ineffective narrative despite it stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements. ""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friend Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan start experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan come to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken. I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development take place a Megan realizes the truth about the weird image she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd device such a moving shadow and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it take too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reach that point. According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not.

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets. 2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beep very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete. 3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation come out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that fall out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model. The Krups still work fine, but it wa white and various area were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 year is that now the water come out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line. This model also ha a charcoal water filter packet and come with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter. We like the look of this coffee maker and we notice it doe not show fingerprint on the plastic coated stainless steel finish. Some people have commented that their coffee pot drip when they pour and that some lid are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot. The pot on this coffee maker doe not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning. Finally, we note this coffee maker ha a three year manufacturer's warranty. Hopefully, if ours last three year it will also last for fifteen year like our previous Krups. Update 10/18/13: After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate. Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing. I have posted two image of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still work perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop.",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet. Those of u who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?"" When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else. I took off one star for each of the three problem I found with this product: Problem #1: The product fit the mounting hole fine, a the pre-measurement assured it would. The problem wa the how the seat closed. The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet. This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between user leg and onto the floor. There wa no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue. Problem #2: There is no pressure adjustment. Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi. Ouch. Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments. Problem #3: As you see from many other comments, the bidet cause a big gap in the front of the toilet seat. Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewer are doing this), buy shim to fill the gap, or....buy a different product. I built a nice house and it look quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front. The gap on our toilet seat wa greater than other reviewer due to problem #1 (see pic).",0,4

As an actress she ha the ability to display criminal type and state of viciousness and depravity that traditionally male display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it doe that,since all comedy have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though doe not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor a opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film center around and at film end we have the male character trying to open up to the outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and join him in his new life. Really a spoof and it ok since the star breathe life in film,and it a very learned and ha some intelligent idea and they are played for laughs...but the character change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders...",0,4

Apparently the movie wa never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort. It brings to mind the story by Gurdjieff of the evil magician, a the movie show how Truman is really not in control of anything, a it is all orchestrated from above. Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too doe Truman believe that he make real choice and that he is free. Little doe he know that he is life in a ""cage"". To keep Truman from discovering the Truth, the ""media"" is employed to constantly shape his opinion and to suppress any questioning of the reality in which he lives. This ha scary parallel to today world, where the mainstream medium and manufactured opinion poll act like the ancient Greek chorus in shaping public opinion the way the controller wish it to be.

This is the wrong whisk when doing larger job such a mixing a batch of brownie but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drink and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edge of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisk cannot do. This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it hold up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisk I have struggled with the handle breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handle and rusting the wire until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keep water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tine are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it hold up well under stress. This is a great whisk for smaller job in the kitchen.

I wa also pleasantly surprised by how well the touch screen work through the plastic. At some point I will probably make some modification so the bag fit snugly on the cross-tube. Right now the velcro strap are too long, and the bottom of the bag is flexible, so when you pull the strap tight it cause the bag to bend around that tube. Because the strap don't have the hook portion of the velcro covering the entire length, they barely attach. If there wa a rounded rubber support on the backside that rested on top of the tube this would be perfect. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this.

It's a quick read, and I enjoyed it fine. Except for one thing. The very end is just terrible. The end of the plot about a pirate fleet taking over system and disrupting communication is fine, obvious, but fine. But after that ends, the book go on to give a tag about the end of the romantic tension between two of the lead characters. It's a terrible scene. I mean, it's short, but just ridiculous. Not funny, not romantic: I wa embarrassed on the characters' behalf. The romance isn't built up in a way that should lead to a scene that is so juvenile.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,Not my normal reading genre. No murder. No thrills. No adventure. No elves. No weapons. No car chases. No mystery. No spaceships. No enemies. No cowboy & indians. No horror. No court scenes. No trip to Heaven. No trip to Hell. No spiritual battles. No angels. No demons. But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experience a he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hand of most writer I would have probably been bored to tear but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirk and idiosyncrasy of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who ha spent many year in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip. If you're the type that like easy going story with no stress or book that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy. If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner working of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It wa a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation. 1 Star = Pathetic 2 Stars = Fair 3 Stars = Good 4 Stars = Excellent 5 Stars = Life changing For those who give me a negative vote on my review please comment and let me know why.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"""Andi Under Pressure"" by Amanda Flower, is a great mystery novel for kids, based on cute, realistic character and an intriguing plot. Twelve-year-old Andi Boggs and her friend Colin are thrilled to be attending a prestigious science camp at a university in Kildeer, Ohio. But from day one, the camp is plagued with a series of prank which slowly escalate to the point of being dangerous. Andi and Colin, being extremely curious and fairly fearless, decide to put their investigative prowess to good use, and in true Nancy Drew-esque fashion, they get themselves into pickle and seemingly impossible situation pretty often. I would recommend this book to anybody who ha kid who enjoy a good mystery novel. The plot is interesting and draw the reader in right away. (I read the whole thing on a 3 hour flight this past weekend). The character have good heart and positive goal and the book is clean and safe for young readers. Lessons about integrity and honesty are sprinkled throughout the story but they are underlying theme more than overt lessons.

CATS ... what can you say other than that? At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5. And not having to brave the claw and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !! Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"". So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them (and me!).

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it"" The story of the prodigal son is one of the most prominent parable Jesus tell in the Gospels. A young man reject his father, take his inheritance, and foolishly spends it. The son finally decides to return home hoping that his father will forgive him and accept him back a servant. Unexpectedly the father doesn't even wait for an apology. The father run out to his son and throw him a huge banquet. This parable is both comforting and infuriating. It's comforting to see the unconditional love of the father, yet infuriating that the father doesn't ask for an apology or make him work back his favor. A lot of Christians today live in this paradox. They love the unconditional love of God but are irritated when God show so much love and mercy towards our enemies. We even do not like to accept undeserved grace. Legalism is born from this idea that we must earn back God's favor and fortune. ""One of the greatest challenge of the spiritual life is to receive God's forgiveness."" Our heart need not to be focused on searching for God or loving God more. We need to allow God to love us. Nouwen spin the parable a bit in this book. We always look at where fit between the sons: are we the lost son that return or the stubborn brother that doesn't love? Nouwen challenge u to think about the father. Yes, in the parable the role of the father is the Lord, but God command u to be like Him. Are you capable of loving like the father? Accepting and forgiving without an apology?",1,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It is definitely not a big and strong a the industrial cage you find at the gym, but it perfect for a workout room or basement at home.

If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slide backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches. It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall. But the primary reason for only 3 star is the bench. The base of the bench is a T shape. This is great if you are laying back a the leg the jet out provide support. But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail. It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all. After two month I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench wa of higher quality. The seat portion of the bench ha 3 setting to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart. The entire seat barely incline an inch. When incline benching it hard to fight the sensation that your body want to slide down the bench. Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing. It take some force. And finally, the wheel on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible. I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheel to hit the ground. My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels. She practically ha to lift the end above her head.

It ha some unique, if unlikely, aspect that pull me out of the movie a little.

A quick hone and a few stroke on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update star and review after I get some time in on it out in the field. It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size a well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch. Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rub a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily a well. I feel like I've done anything out of bound to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It hold the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone.

It ended just how it wa supposed to to make my world happy. I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it wa pretty clean a far a romance go. I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line book have crossed over and include scene that are definitely not clean in my opinion. And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic. I'm just giving my opinion on the matter. In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but thing leading up to it are. If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you. However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you. There is also some swearing.",0,4

We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he get excited. He's ten month old now and 120 pounds. This collar ha feature that I really appreciate. It ha a vibrate and a beep a well a the shock feature. I've actually only used the shock once and that wa when he got out and wa running around in the road. I tried snacks, toy and everything else I could think of. I wa terrified he wa going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock. It scared him and he ran inside. You can pick the intensity that is used. I just used a 2. For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep. That usually get him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature. I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he know he need to stop if he get buzzed. The beep work great a an attention getter. He know when he hears it that he need to look at u to see what he need to do. I'm very happy that we bought this.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"""Intacto"", the Spanish film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea apparently borrowed from ""The Deer Hunter"", with a bit of subtle sci-fi themening worthy of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"". The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all these early Ingemar Bergman film make his character all the more credible. The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the film revolves around the participation of the character in very dangerous, even fatal, game of chance, like the Russian theme of the roulette of ""The Deer Hunter"".

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I started looking for climbing toy for our now 17mth old before Christmas & after hour online, this wa my fav. I planned to buy it for our daughter big Santa gift but hesitated after reading some review about poor safety features...when the priced dropped after Christmas, I'd still not found anything I liked better so I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I ignored the few negative reviews. It is absolutely perfect for our energetic, climbing toddler. She is able to climb the wall with no trouble, the slide is fast & long enough for her to enjoy, she can get a ball into the basketball hoop herself & while the potential is there with most any toy for a child to use it incorrectly and possibly get hurt, under minimal supervision, I see no imminent risk in this toy. (the concern I read were toddler ""diving"" through the hole for football to be thrown through). That particular opening in question doe not hit our child in a place height wise where that is an issue. If she's standing, the hole is around her belly, if she sits, she can peek through the hole, but with the majority of her body safely on the platform, she isn't likely to fall from it. A child, if intentionally trying to dive through, coud get it through it I guess but it doesnt seem very probable. Again, I'm glad I bypassed that info and ordered anyway. I wa also glad it wa not quite a huge a I'd envisioned, it will be easy to move outside in warmer weather. It wa also easy to put together which is a major plus! As a child development professional, I'd also recommend this for building gross motor skills. Definitely recommend this toy, we are so pleased with it...most importantly, so is our child! Alas, she ha something she is allowed to climb on & it satisfies that natural interest for her, safely!",1,4

The book start over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She move to Auckland where she ha an IT job and move next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book go along we read a Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book wa the language a being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do thing here and our language. The author used phrase like Kia Ora a hello since the character next door wa Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writer to grasp the different cultural difference and language.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I always thought of Night Gallery a the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mix the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery a early a 1964 when TZ wa cancelled. Is Night Gallery a great a TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery open with Rod Serling describing each story with it own unique painting, which usually ha to do with something in the episode. Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaf a bit to be desired, a the picture is a bit scratched in some part and color seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume. The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season.

When it go on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone us a an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway. When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light come on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few month Without a problem. My husband just told me he love it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It get pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door. Update! I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully: Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery go down and it stop working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three day like you did when it wa new. I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors.",1,4

During that time it kept my tropical aquarium at a solid 78F. One morning, I went to feed my fish and the water wa much warmer than normal. I checked the thermometer and it read 90F, luckily my fish were all still alive. I turned the heater knob down to 70 and allowed the water to cool down on it own. After several hour it held 82. I hadn't done a water change in nearly a week so it's not that I let the water level drop. No big deal, these thing happen. Luckily these heater have a lifetime warranty. I contacted Aqueon by email and received no response. I sent another one a week later, and no response. I couldn't find a phone number for them. Look, sometimes heater malfunction. A manufacturer can do all they can to prevent it and back it up with a guarantee. But if they don't stand by their own guarantee or even answer your emails, it isn't a crap product; it's a crap company. If you are going to buy an Aqueon heater, I recommend the Aqueon Pro instead of this one. They are better unit in my experience. Otherwise, have a look at the Eheim Jager, or Fluval offerings.",0,4
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spoke so I replaced it with this one. The one that cracked wa the original spoke guard that wa on the bike when I bought it over 10 year ago. It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of mile on the bike, and over the year I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile. This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) a the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years. Unfortunately, it broke at the spoke the same a the original one after only a few week and way fewer than 100 miles. When I realized that it wa loose, I noticed that all three place where it connected to the spoke where broken and it wa spinning freely. I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points. I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike work just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes. I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it.",0,4

After all, he ha a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the service of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographer in the history of film. And what to we get? About 90 minute of mind-numbing agony a Godard play film-school in-joke and stretch scene out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.

He's being an as to push her away because he really want to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx.... SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future book by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery reader turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better way to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters.

When shopping for my kid I seek out the brand because it one I know I can trust. This year is Jaxs first Christmas so it an extra special one for us. Of course Im going to go to a name I trust! At this age of almost one, he doesnt show much preference for toys. He basically like anything and everything because he want to explore this great big world. This is that rare time that I can get him what I want because he not going to tell me otherwise! The Melissa & Doug sound puzzle are the perfect gift for little ones. They help their growth and development with motor skills, problem solving and general thinking. Oh yeah, and they are super fun! My older kid have always liked puzzle and Jax is no different! Even though this is for 2+, he immediately started trying to put it together. He doesnt quite have the logic and reasoning to get the fit right but he sure had fun trying and big sister Paige helped him! As with all their products, the quality is good and durable. Lots of puzzle are flimsy and don't last long but these are thick wooden piece with little red tab for easy removal. When you lift up or put down the piece, it make the animal sound. I love that I can also teach Jax what sound animal make while we do this together. The Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They will think of it a a toy but a mom we know, they are learning!",1,4

The depth of this story is absolutely brilliant. I stayed up late just to finish this story. Its so sad what you go through with a devastating tornado. This is the first story I read about the after effect of the tornado. The way this author wrote about the tornado and the after effect wa amazing. The character breakdown Jersey Cameron go through alot in this story. She is such a brave person, at time you don't know how she overcomes some of what she does. But she doe overcome alot and it captivates you. Jersey Cameron is brave and sweet, but she can be so mean when she need to be. I loved her character. Jersey's mom and Marin. Jersey's mom claim to be something she isnt. She seems brave but she isn't at all. I didn't really like her character. Marin is Jerseys half sister and she is the sweetest cutest little girl. I enjoyed her character. Ronnie after the tornado wa just a waste he wa not brave at all. He didn't do a well a Jersey did and I just didn't like him. Jersey didn't really know her mom like she thought. But what she find out. It take so much for her to believe it. Everybody should read this story. It open your eye to what could really happen in a tornado. Its emotional on every level. Very Powerful. Riveting. Just absolutely AMAZING.

I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewer here, I'm a bit confused a to whom the target-audience is. The simple, jargon-free language appeal to the lay-person (which is always welcome in text geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concept give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn wa attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious. I know that it seems superficial, but one of the way I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through it examples. I know (for a fact) that my student excitedly scan a text ... looking for still from work they know/love. The Lean Forward moment us many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choice to get the cinema-neonate involved.

This is so very handy for me because I work night and don't need to leave thing lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!!

The light never turn off though, and it never change color.. all it doe is indicate when it is getting power. I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie foot and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poop and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell. I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cone out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pad a poctured and one pad fit in the travel cage I have and 2 pad fit in their night home cage. I just use my toy shovel each morning and it great. I wa able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box. Persobally these make the cage look neat and fresh and I think it better to not have a much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing. Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars.",1,4

The eleventh and twelfth season episode clearly lack the polish and good story line of all the other episodes. James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth season is sorely missed. As good a the new character are such a William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines. It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord wa not the easiest individual to work with. His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth. Without Danno and all the other wonderful personality around him, he rather fade into background. The very final episode ha Lord a the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat. The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme). Seasons 1 through ten are stellar.",0,4

For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price a a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this a a bottle opener it easily pay for itself in term of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew.

The construction is excellent and the material feel sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seam are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wrap are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wrap that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This wa plenty of support for me on handstand and snatch both, and the wrap didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps. Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessory after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stay clean and smelling nice. I received these wrap at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thought so others can make informed product decisions.",1,4

To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone a compared with X10i. Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cable that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal. I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and it sound quality fair quite well against the Ety a well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fit my book.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Forget that this is War and Peace and just enjoy it a an excellent Hollywood movie. If you want something that approximates Tolstoy's War and Peace, then check out the Russian adaptation made in 1968.

It's a pity that we couldn't have the heart of the 1956 version and the intelligence of the 1968 wrapped up in the same film. The solution: If you want Tolstoy's War and Peace, then read it. It's a long novel, but it not a difficult novel. But a far a movie go, the Hollywood treatment work well. A few year have passed since I wrote the above review. I liked the film even better on a third viewing. It's not Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, but it's a good movie. Think of it a another Gone With the Wind.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Potentially good earphone with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 star based on the unit I received. First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus. Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop a well a phone. Audio (especially music) feel little flat a compared to other earphone I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume control operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphone I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range. Two major issue these earphone have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keep falling off the ear even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I wa walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphone get fully charged in le than 2 hour (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minute and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minute they switched off a battery wa completely off. So I could use them for le than 1.5 hour after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the unit I received have this defect. Conclusion - These earphone surely have potential but aforementioned two major issue disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",0,4

Turns on light a desired and sends IFTT alert a well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

I usually wear 8-8.5, and though I prefer a wide, I can wear most regular width shoes. These happen to fit me beautifully, but they don't seem like a true wide width right out of the box. However, the beauty of good quality leather boot is that they will stretch to fit over time. (Google ha several good idea for breaking in leather shoes. Though I didn't need it this time, the rubbing alcohol trick totally works.) I expected these to be tight, but they're not. My calf are about 14.5 inches, and the boot do fit over my legging or jeans, but with NO room to spare. Keep that in mind if you have large calves. (I noticed that Timberland is now making this type of boot with an elastic inset in the shaft for wider calves. I don't think they are nearly a cute, though.) This boot is GORGEOUS. The leather is such a great color (tobacco) and it look even prettier now that I've used mink oil on it. I can't wait for Fall so I can wear these boot all the time. They seem to be very well made, very expensive looking. I have short legs, so I love that they stop a few inch below the knee. If they were any taller, I think they'd look like they were wearing me, instead of the other way around. These are absolutely lovely. So many tall boot look cheap or gaudy to me, but these are wonderful. They are so comfortable already, and I know they will only get better.

Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is a good a any Leonard adaption. Seeing his character with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens. Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writer to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novella loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other character get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan work much better when it departs from the story told by the show. I take a poor a view of mining company a Leonard does, but the coal plotline get a bit preachy. Again, Justified better capture the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for job and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders. If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who ha seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book.",0,4

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 time and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent. It ha a rubber flap that stay secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increase the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog know how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stop her from the loud bark. She know that when she ha it on she is off duty. She calm down immediately when it's on. It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw result within days. I have used it now for 3 month and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it. She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few time until she understood her limits. It wa hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never get shocked any more when I put it on her. It just help her relax and keep her in check. As long a she ha it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kid on skateboards, and other barking dog ha ceased. The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different color instead of black.",1,4

Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot! Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in year because, by striking coincidence, it turn out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) ha gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequence if Wyatt press charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case. Typed out like that, it kind of sound like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those page consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes. But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The character are well written, with real flaw and insecurities. Their emotion are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenario are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive.

This also come in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both. I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sport but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel work smoothly but move in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 foot and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses. Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hand are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light level against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels. This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious. I've worn mine a a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still look great. The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment. I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version a well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too. There's nothing not to like about this watch.

It might be from the red dye. But, I am not giving up too easily, a I've worn these many time before the skin/ foot concern occurred. I really hope I can keep wearing these.

Conclusion: A metaphorical and unshakeable look at the possible loss of control of rabies among humans, 28 Days Later mark the return of Danny Boyle from his flop The Beach. Petring with his realism and astonishing in his contrasting moods, 28 Days Later certainly ha more in common with the dark masterpiece of the director Trainspotting - he is frightening, drolle and convincing, and will linger with his audience, despite his flaws, long after the end.",1,4

Instead, player try to collect crown to become the emperor of Europe. Each player chooses his home city and draw two order from their eight. These dictate the action the player will undertake in turn. Players acquire money, build castles, build unit and attack opposing players. The fight is slightly different from the classic risk too.

Fast and fast, but refreshing all the same. Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's just a fast, but it need a little more concentration. It's kind of a story of coming-of-age - heroin continues to go and come back between her first love and the different guy before she decides.

Much of Jules behavior is whiny and annoying, which I could forgive if it wa used to greater comic effect, but the laugh just aren't there. Other character aren't much better: Maureen, another fat white vampire, is a little le irritating than Jules, if only because her appearance are in measured doses; and the antogonist, Malice X, seems an amalgamation of every movie stereotype of black men. Only Doodlebug, Jules' cross-dressing former sidekick, breath any sort of life into this story, although even s/he can't save the flagging pace of the book's final third.

Pro-Sense ha some good product - I'm using their hip and joint supplement for my 14 year old dog with real success. However, this water additive is a failure here. None of my dog will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowl through out the house at all time - 6 dog tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowl with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three time yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dog went right to them. My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients.

There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. "" Does that count?). Gloria Swanson play Nella Vago, a young singer who ha a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lack warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella return home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera ha refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she go to the apartment of the young man and make love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. "" But now she ha to choose between a career and the man she love (apparently having both doe not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gown by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy wa based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed le like a play.

One thing I didn't realize before purchasing wa EXACTLY how one got the photo on the frame. I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would be a USB cable for transfer. This isn't the case. You need to put the photo on the memory card. I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..]. That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick. Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame. I enjoyed the included Kodak software. It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issue and I had to delete it. If it will work for you, it is well worth installing. I use my regular graphic program now.

Even the logic of allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware make no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that mean war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor wa their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US a a result, a claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany?

Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the character and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier book probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene pile on dreadful scene until the book come across a truly sadistic. There is an ugly American (Billy) who seek to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many page of this behavior. I suppose these scene are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spread his own feces on Billy's face, beat him, and make him stand in the corner. And then doe it again. This come in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual piece of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel. Oh, did I mention that the book open with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves? Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye. Wow.

It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wit end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar wa on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera.

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheet of foam, a well a some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragon are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of piece - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old wa overwhelmed, so I had to piece the thing together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kid on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheet of thinner form that easily tear a well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam hole and piece can be difficult. Regardless, separating the piece in the foam sheet took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragon took around 90 minute - for an adult. The toy itself wa OK. If your child like Legos they'll probably like this a well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragon wore off, the toy wa largely forgotten. So while the Bloco Dragons are offered at a good price, and some kid will love them, I can't give them an unqualified ""thumbs up.",0,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think ha middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cup would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken liver for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface work great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spot or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which doe not come with a lid), I like it more a an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what item your putting into it, plus ""if"" it wa put together correctly from the company. Overview: I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding option inside of it, the only issue is that if the item you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue: The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, ha very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts: One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouch and bag are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slip thru a fast a loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion: So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin item like pens, paper and pocket knife and other ""low profile"" item that would fit.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I did return mine - I have all tile floor with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slipper walking on the tile. The original cork built-up sol on the OG clog are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That mean not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hour a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekend I bet they'd be GREAT. DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn a a shoe). Charisma ha a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my foot is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length wa perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toe nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minute I tried. Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near a tough and stiff a the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toe which are not bulbous and padded a are the OG clog style. The bottom of these sol are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",1,4

Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there wa a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candle stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" ha a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keep falling off when you move or carry it, because it doe not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the hole and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it wa lit, it wa producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK!

Beyond that, it get everywhere. It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other room it get tracked). I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it wa the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.

Then there's what I think of a the short-hold-handle, that spare me from having to wrap the leash around my hand if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason.

I am left wanting a further book to bridge the significant gap between this one and the rest of the Hannibal Lector books. I originally gave it 3 star out of 5 but when I actually sat down to write my thought and feelings, I downgraded to 2 star a I could not justify any more than that.",0,4

It also come with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empty from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to le dust getting back into the air for us. But there are some drawbacks. There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpet and you will feel a if you have been at the gym doing push ups. The unit doe a great job on hardwood and tile floor however and I would certainly recommend it for that. This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms. You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that. You can also detach the unit from it base and carry it to clean stairs, etc. This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rug however a the suction is too great and it simply pick up the rug.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved Desiree Holt's book, Joy Ride. As a matter of fact, I can honestly say that Joy Ride turned me into a Rock Band Romance Junky. With that in mind, I'm here to tell you that Aftershock, the sequel to Joy Ride, ha more than satisfied my appetite for this sub-genre of romance. Aftershock is a truly amazing read. In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride. You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, a well a getting to know the other member of the band Lightnin' a bit better. But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotion agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experience and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents. You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy detail of how Syd and Rick fall for each other. Then hold on to your hat because thing get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture. Let me tell you. Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villain and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story. You are going to love hating this villain. Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors. I love her writing style. Her character are always so real. The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention. All this is true in Aftershock but she go beyond the usual. I felt like I wa really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book.

I ran multi-million dollar job and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your finger buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blade a well) Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blade are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that fold up and out of the way. The balance is not quite a good a the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 buck I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractor buying 24 tooth blade to speed production when I wa an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blade a they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut. The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or wa a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",1,4

We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her. We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friend in the ministry let him down, and then ridicule him publicly. It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situation portrayed. This movie definitely keep your interest, some part are funny and some are sad. Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching. Even though there were not any big name actor in this film, it wa well done and enjoyable. I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusade when I wa twelve year old. Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more. The movie is suitable for all age and clean. Our family highly recommends this, and give it five stars.",1,4

If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase. My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall. This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volume would shake it loose almost immediately. Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector wa probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair. I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down. I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector. The repair wa beyond my soldering skill and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set.",0,4

She doe the movement up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns. Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful! I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancer in the other dvd are doing.

Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for it hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat? I would never kill a cat to use it hide to make a toy for a cow!!

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 star because there were a few thing wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemish on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted wa bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller. All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec wa in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i wa mistaken. I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which wa partially destroyed upon opening the box. Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case. UPDATE *just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable. So 1 star is bumped up.",1,4

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Well this wa excellent. I thought this wa the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden). Pros: - John and Sig's relationship. She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do thing that matter throughout the book, which make her another actor who ha agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy. - The introduction of element of Japanese mythology and character wa nicely done. - John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instinct in check. - Supporting character remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomer like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head. - The first rule of Fight Club is... - John's family is known for rescuing virgins. - Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense wa in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving part that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"". Cons: - Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa.
