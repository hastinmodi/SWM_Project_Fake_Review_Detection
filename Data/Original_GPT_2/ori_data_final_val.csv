Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" ha Argentina made such an amazing movie. Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone. There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begin high over a soccer (football) stadium, pan down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowel of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY. Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that a it wa happening. Anyway, back to the story...it's epic. Told somewhat in flashback, it cover over 30 year in the life of a government employee whose life wa altered dramatically over choice made in his youth.

Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signal that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speaker and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out). Wiring involved wa all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speed downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed a when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster product (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right? Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movie wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results). One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port unit must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, a Netgear's spec for the ""XEB1004-100NAS 4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically state one unit ha one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit ha 4 ports.

While the product description doe mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one. It's silent, totally silent. Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs. A pleasant slow event heat. The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed. There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch. Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handle with rubber grip that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hand but that ha been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewer have stated the plate do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collar and plate and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collar from my old dumbbell which did have the o-ring and the plate stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collar is to rotate the plate in opposite direction which give you more leverage on the collar and tightens them more securely. Overall these handle feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 star only because of the plate becoming loose but a long a you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much,1,4

I will say that the better your internet connection, the better off you will be with this toy. Leapfrog doesn't have the easiest to navigate site. It is not user intuitive and usually take a couple of try to get any of our Leapfrog toy customized. The sync function at the end is an especial pain. Violet ha an ""on/off"" paw, a bedtime music paw, a musical paw with popular children's songs, and a paw that make Violet talk with customizable phrases. You can make the bedtime music play for longer amount of time by pressing it multiple times. You can customize what children's music the other paw plays. The remaining paw is conversation for your child and it is priceless to have the toy say ""I love you, (insert child's name)"". It also is customized with info such a you child's favorite food and color. Some of the conversation can be a little nonsensical but that is part of the fun, I suppose. If it were a breeze to program and a little more educational, I would give it 5 stars. It is a great toy though and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for any child.",1,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I almost gave up on these because I just could not get them on - then I did some reading and found there wa a trick to it: Turn the sock inside out almost all of the way so that you can just put your toe in. Put your toe in, align it properly so that your heel will line up with the heel of the sock, and then basically roll it onto your foot bit by bit. I'm a Women's 11 and ordered the large; I thought it wa too small for me until I tried this. Turns out they fit well. These are very well-made, high-quality, strong compression socks; in fact, they're probably the first true compression sock I've used given that I never had to do much to get others on. They are quite comfortable once adjusted right. They are very strictly contoured, so if they aren't sitting just right, they feel off. The grey band over the top of the foot near the ankle seems to want to come to rest right where I flex my ankle, which is very uncomfortable. I find I have to pull this part down towards the toe until it rest on top of my foot rather than in front of my ankle. So if you get these, and you're not used to real compression socks, be prepared to fiddle with them a bit. They're great for exercise and really do reduce soreness.

If you are going to use it a a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size. Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place. Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issue with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

Spray the back plate and prong with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the leg and wing to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the leg facing away from the motor. In 80 minute it wa done without any problems. It wa the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this put out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it wa just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey. I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is le of a problem, but I can see lighter food or unbalanced load have an issue.

I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing le than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowing from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tell a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all woman portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claim that this is so because all woman have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meet a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideal of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She try to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he end up killing her because his passion and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it doe illustrate the point that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who wa demonised by the US government.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The Birthday Supplies Kit is such a great idea and will cover your base for any small (8 or fewer) people at a birthday party. The kit includes what you need for eating & drinking--plates, napkins, cup and plastic cutlery, a well a the decorations--tablecloth, small centerpiece, balloons, streamer and curling ribbon. Oh yeah, and 12 candles!! My tablecloth is the cute panda table cloth, not red like the photo. It's actually much cuter and match the plate and napkin in design. The whole setup look great, buttoned up and complete. In my experience with birthday parties, if you were having more kid than 8, it would be more affordable and le wasteful to supplement this set with extra plate & fork than to buy a second set. And most kid don't ever touch their napkins... Don't forget the hand wipe though, always good to have on hand. This set is so useful and saved me a trip to the store, time and gas. If you got this stuff at Target, it would be so much more expensive too. However, this same stuff at the Dollar Store would only total $10-13 (plus tax if applicable) if you bought this ala carte.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"What I liked: Alice in Zombieland is about a girl that find out that her father wasn't really simply a mental case when he locked the family in at night to protect them from terrible creatures. The monster are real, and they're coming, and they will eat you. Ali is reeling from the tragedy of losing her entire family while adjusting to her new reality where zombie exist and she can now see them. Teaming up with others at her school, she must fight to prove that she's worthy of sharing their secret and fighting the good fight. What I didn't like: The zombie in Alice in Zombieland are not zombies, but rather some type of soul-eating spirit monsters. There is little of Alice in Wonderland to be found in this book. At the beginning, I wa under the impression that there would be more, but it quickly devolves to only tangentially related chapter title and a main character with the same name. Given that zombie and Alice in Wonderland are the two main reason I picked the title up, it wa a bit of a recipe for disappointment for me. Also, the insta-love with Cole Holland wa ridiculous. Even though Showalter tried to explain it away with some sort of magical something or another, it turned me off their relationship for a big chunk of the novel. Final thoughts: Alice in Zombieland can be enjoyable, if you know what to expect. Don't come in expecting a retelling of Alice in Wonderland in any form, nor true zombies. Be prepared for the ridiculously executed insta-love and some heavy melodrama. If you can handle these thing and enjoy the characters, you can find in this novel a quite different take on the teen fighting evil theme. I'll likely continue the series.",0,4

It offer a lot of scene mode and they are not that difficult to get to, it just take a little time to get used to the buttons. The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need. This Elph now offer a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability. It's camera solution CD-ROM software ha improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures. Cons: It's feature are a bit basic but it offer just enough for those point and shot customers. So if you want a lot of manual feature you might want to pay more for another camera. The LCD might get thumbprint very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD. Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search. It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you. The Function/Set button might be too small, but I have small hand so I'm cool with their size. Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for it few design flaw and it's price. It's a good shooter, and it feature set make it quite flexible for a camera of it size.

The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incident with these woman and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It get old in no time and is just discouraging to me a a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much le one the audience REALLY care about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who come across a one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroine ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's a bad a the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bit of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for it own entertainment value. Even if the idea wa to make this a comedy, it still fall flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performance that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that take place in 1871-1872. She also wa blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who wa an editor for 20th century literary giant like Fitzgerald and Hemingway. It wa Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'. He wa the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episode rather than hatching out intricate plots. In addition, it wa Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting wa full of tough time and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early draft of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism. Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn. He suggested that she find a more symbolic title. When she came up with title like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there wa not enough human suggestion. When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins wa satisfied that this wa the right one. Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written wa inferior & threw it out. Perkins prodded her to get going again. This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be a true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.

This book make biology fun and interesting. It ha detailed explainations of thing and give clear, colorful diagram that are very useful. You could use this book a a biology encyclopedia or use it to teach yourself any topic pertaining to bio.

This work better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it hold onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion wa almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself. A few scuff have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard a a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something a basic a a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fit well and is comfortable enough, but a with any gun of length there are certain position with me that don't work a well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it doe try it best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concern have always been related with the dark side of the human soul. This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the trace of ""The crime considered a one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"". But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds u to: Psycho. But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis. On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests u a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"". And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden trace you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

I have had to re-order this item on several occasion to replenish my office stash a I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points: 1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect a the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bar themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper ha been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bar are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bar TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is base on 1,200 calorie per day (3 meal a day for 3 day at 2 bar per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calorie per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bar are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, doe not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergency and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: a I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catch the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",1,4

I ordered 9 of these bulb and installed them in 3 ceiling fan in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulb in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other one that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulb throughout my house. Base style include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulb simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED light make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these light being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulb almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulb in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.",0,4

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I want to give this story more stars, but there are a few aspect that I find too far fetched which brings it back to 3. The story is well written, the character are very relatable and easy to like. But my issue with the story is how so many character have special power or ability for one reason or another. Yet, there's no explanation a to why. It's just - here are 5 people and they're all enhanced for some reason.... that will miraculously work to their advantage in the end. I love paranormal stories, but there ha to be some reason or explaination or secret government testing or ANYTHING for that matter to explain why there are so many people with abilities. Other than that, the story is well written to show how Jade is struggling to overcome her limitation because she's an empath. She's a very likable character and the author doe a nice job of making you want to root for Jade you succeed.

I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit! I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It wa packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress a a gift. I removed the dress from the package and wa happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with le expensive item that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress. The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking). VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS. Size: Runs one size small, a many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.) I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know. Height: At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not a curiously high a a many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5 surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would. Fit: Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me. Quality/Warmth: Leather is soft and nice. Lining is ideal and warm. The top stud actually keep the lace in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special need there) a just average). Can't attest to durability bc they're new. And, of course, the lace provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper let you keep it that way (and make the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot. WHAT THE ...?!m There is a slippery finish on the sol that i wa sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rub off a you wear it. Still - make you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing. Not cool. Lost a star.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movie about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right? There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. "" Does that count?). Gloria Swanson play Nella Vago, a young singer who ha a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lack warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella return home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera ha refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she go to the apartment of the young man and make love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. "" But now she ha to choose between a career and the man she love (apparently having both doe not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gown by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy wa based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed le like a play. Two other interesting tidbit about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman wa Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter wa Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.",1,4

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great coloring case. It ha a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two set of marker - pip squeak sized small marker and regular size. As other review have noted, it cost about the same a it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and marker separately at full price. The separate will go on sale, and so will this case. Crayola is good quality. The product are not light fast, so over time, pic left in window or bright light will fade. Colors are bright and marker last longer than dollar store products. Crayons are the best, since many other brand are waxy and weak. This set ha washable markers, but not the washable crayon or pencils. So, need supervision for small child who might write on the wall. Crayons are made in the US; pencil made in Brazil; case and marker made in Vietnam. The carrying case ha plastic shell glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers. It look all neat and tidy, and the latch hold it closed fine for carrying around. I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tip have been damaged. Sets drive me nut when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets. The plastic shell on this one won't come out, which is good for a full set, because I much sturdier, but mean I can't gut it easily later. The carrying case ha a minion with teddy bear on one side and a minion playing a guitar on the other. My particular set came with two of the same color crayon: banana bonanza.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"It's ironic a I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harness in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all part of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm strap so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpit when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" part to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arm through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pull against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).",1,4

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instruction except I used a planter and did 2 container instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds. After a few day in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it wa growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it wa full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it wa growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered a I've been careful hoping to prevent that. One of our two kitten eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bite some off and play with it. I put some clipping in their nightly dinner. No issue with vomiting and they both eat it just fine. At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the container and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold. I read that overwatering cat grass turn the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets. Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though a mold growth ha everything to do with moisture. The grass wa lush, green, healthy, and the root are strong and deep. 4 star because it only lasted u a month but we will give it another shot. USDA Organic. Uploading some photo so you can get a closer look. The photo collage wa after 5 day of growth, when the kitten first tried it. The last photo wa on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended.",1,4
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I don't give out five star often, but this movie merit 5 at least. My degree in history came in handy for this film.

The film is another rendition of James Fennimore Cooper's famous tome. However, it's 100x better than the old Hollywood film of the same name. This one is nuanced, showing the motivation of the French a well a the English, the nature of the Indians fighting for each side (i.e. the French-Indian War), a well a the colonist (i.e. us) who are cast adrift by an English parent country itself under siege by the powerful French regime opposing them in every (war) theatre.

Two faults: Poor gluing of the magnet under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pin up. I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnet from rising fully to the top. I reglued it and another one that wa loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of it socket), and then added 2 drop of super glue to the side of the others a well. Problem #1 solved. Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dot on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it. The bump obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim. The veneer must be very thin. There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnet from pushing the wood up.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Let me just start out by saying that I read this book, and don't understand why it got so many negative reviews, or why it average rating is only 3 stars. I guess that's the great thing about listening to your gut and ignoring reviews.... many time people's reading experience are so personal that it just doesn't pay to read a book based on others' reviews. This book is basically a collection of different people's life stories. These are people Bronson handpicked to interview, based on how interesting or believable he found their story to be. All of the people interviewed have somehow found a more fulfilling, more rewarding life, but usually not before year of struggle. Many of these story deal with career, but not all. It becomes apparent that often happiness is a tricky thing, to be found in place where you don't expect it. One of my favorite story wa the one of the guy who wa getting a PhD in English but then ended up becoming a chef. Another one I liked wa about the guy who wanted to work in golf. I thought every one of these story were interesting, and believable. What I liked the most about this book wa it desire to probe life and reality a they are, instead of getting bogged down in neat or too-simple self help explanation or methods. Believe me, I have read a few self-help book during challenging times. Believe me, they did not work. The reason, I think, is because often they provide you with too-ready theory of life instead of encouraging you to think for yourself to find the best solution for yourself. This book doesn't do that. Instead, it make you realize (at least it made me realize) that achieving contentment is not a simple a we want to think, but it's something that's still possible with a lot of patience, time, and perseverance.

I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scare easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it wa an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet. My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirit and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away. I watch show like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I swim everyday a part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eye safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out. These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lens of the goggles are described by the manufacturer a anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issue with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eye are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water. I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmer like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time. I must disclose that this product wa received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion wa not altered due to the product being discounted.

The DVD doe give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored special is five out of seven special which I now own this one. I normally do give away any spoiler about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version ha walter dropping alot of F word on stage during the preformance.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"**UPDATED AT THE END** When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good product that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant! GENERAL First off, this shampoo smell great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really doe leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is a bad a some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her! EFFECTIVENESS We have noticed le itching from our dog, something that ha nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she wa a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she ha been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfume and chemical that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredient are known to be natural repellent and we feel safe knowing she is protected! WHY 5 STARS?? - Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product - Smells GREAT! - Contains no harmful chemicals! OVERALL Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin! **UPDATE 03/2012** We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 month now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly help this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!",1,4

I really disliked the character of Genet and the brothers' relationship with her wa just too ridiculous for me. I thought she wa gone for good and then .... I will say no more- don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this book. And it is well worth reading -I just wish it had ended sooner without all the unnecessary plot ""twists"" in the end.

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I initially had high hope for this product. I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that ha built in Hauppauge tuner (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model). I wa thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cable to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network. It worked pretty well for about 10 months. The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months. The cooling fan stopped working and it wa so hot to the touch, it wa making my closet smell like burnt electronics. I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.) And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping. Yawn. I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one. The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area. On the other hand the Hauppauge tuner have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years. As a bonus, the Hauppauge also act a my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes. As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner ha the worst signal, the single ha slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best. So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there. But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 year is a large upside. Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again.",0,4

It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cord weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My finger are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy wa sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And a I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew. Maybe this stuff work on some dogs.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quote the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calorie consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calorie between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then go on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calorie than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pound since 2006. This is a misleading example and conclusion. An increase of 570 calorie (which I highly doubt in the first place), doe not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption wa close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day. However, I do agree that these calorie study are inaccurate, but not because calorie don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which wa a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meal reported on food purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guest (who may have eaten food).

Two cup would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken liver for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface work great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spot or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red.

The video capability is very impressive for such a small camera. The only flaw: when using the zoom feature while taking video, a humming noise is recorded on the video soundtrack.",1,4
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Okay, a a reviewer of Sally Bedell Smith's new biography, ""Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of An Improbable Life"", am I judging the book or it's subject? This is a question I ask myself when I review any biography, particularly one of a controversial figure, like a politician or a royal figure, etc. In this case, it's sort of a toss-up; the book is well-written and the subject ha gone through his life, making both bad and good decisions. These decision - based often on whim and fancy - affect a fair number of people, pigs, and plants, and will continue to affect them, after he assumes the throne upon his 91 year old mother's death. Bedell Smith's bio is just one of many that have been written about Charles over the years, along with the lot on other royal figures, particularly Diana. In the past, these bios have been heavily slanted during the Windsor marriage - Team Charles or Team Diana - but this one is drawn very even handily. The only problem with this book is that if you're a Royal Watcher, you've probably already read part of this book ten time already under other titles, written by other authors. So, if you're a new reader, I can recommend this book. If you're an old hand at the Royals, you can probably skip it.",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Mr. Carroll ha written an interesting book. I read this book in a matter of days, a sure sign it never got boring. I disagreed with Mr. Carroll constantly, but still give the book a high rating. I came away from the book finding Mr. Carroll to be phony. A man rebelling against an overbearing father by entering the Priesthood, a vocation he wa completely unfit for. He showed no respect for his vocation at the seminary where he and his fellow seminarian cursed their director and teachers. He wa ordained and became a professional protester, I don't recall him performing many priestly duties, but he sure did a lot of protesting against the Vietnam War. He did seem to realize he wasn't Priestly material soon after the war ended. I find it amazing how many seminarian and young Priests seemed to lose their Priestly vocation after the war ended and they were in no danger of being drafted. I did find his father to be overbearing and abrasive at times, but it always seemed that his father wa the one reaching out to reconcile with his son. Mr. Carroll is always right and dear ole dad is always wrong, I think he should have evaluated himself and looked more closely at his father's point of view before writing this book. It must feel good knowing you have never been wrong.",1,4

I felt like Duane spent too much time making inside jokes, displaying ""cute"" aspect of wizardry (I don't think I can forgive her for ""WizPod,"" still), and name-dropping about a bajillion previous character so we wouldn't forget about them before they became completely unimportant to the plot. I did like where it led, though--to the terrifying transformation of Nita's partner Kit into a tool of his previous Martian incarnation, and I liked how Nita didn't lose her cool when she wa scared and had to rescue Kit. Despite being about aliens, I saw a disappointing side of ""human"" nature reflected in the two transplanted Martian culture refusing to give up their desire to fight each other--it wa what they lived for and what they died for. Nita and Kit finally acknowledging some of their attraction wa nice, though I would have been just a happy to see a special partnership that wa close and nearly sacred WITHOUT being romance. And I thought it wa odd that Duane spent so much time focusing on stuff Dairine wa doing without actually mixing it into the plot's finale.

The color match my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the side and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issue (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 year old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a le expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pound right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and give him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inch (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit.

Their friendship develops into something more a the two correspond and then finally meet. But, when Rory is caught in what seems to be a lie while Neve jump to the wrong conclusions, their relationship suffers until Rory help Neve see the good in him and learns to trust him again.

Its a story that is tenderly touching when dealing with sad but yet truly genuine concerns. The dancer and the soldier two people wanting to find that everlasting love that they can trust in. Whos to say that they didn't find it in each other? This one is worth taking a chance on!!! Ms. Marcus again writes romance at it finest...

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We adopted Beast, a 60 lb mutt in early October. He seemed to be great, until he started eating my boyfriend thing when we were gone at work. My boyfriend decided to buy a camera so we can see what he's doing when we're gone. Lo and behold the poor guy is so anxious he is howling the whole time we are gone! We had no idea! It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wit end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar wa on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera. He started to howl and the collar beeped 3 times, and when he didn't stop, it finally zapped him. Yes, it wa heartbreaking to hear him yelp, BUT he stopped!! (and it would have been more heartbreaking to give him away). Finally!! He only wear it when we are gone and it's super important to put it on the right way, or else it won't work. First you have to make sure it's right under his head, not low on the neck where a regular collar would sit, but literally right underneath his head. Then you have to make sure it's tight to the point where the actual box won't move if the dog scratches/shakes. You should still be able to fit one finger in, but it should be TIGHT. Then you have to give a good shake before you go, so it's touching the dog's skin, NOT HIS FUR! THEN IT WILL WORK WONDERS! thank you sooo much for this life saving product! at an amazing price!",1,4

I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor light in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that power up from the sun and help you see thing at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It get full sun most of the day and it last an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered event the light ran all night. All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen model of light from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hour on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and run about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line post on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard. The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Dozen Doubloons is a pirate-themed card game for 1-4 players. As the name suggests, there are doubloon involved, and the number 12 is important. The first player to collect a dozen doubloon is the winner. This game is attractively packaged and easy to play. To collect a doubloon, player must create the number twelve using card in their hand or available card on the table. Wild card and 12 card can give player an easy doubloon, and block card can be used to hinder an opponent. Dozen Doubloons ha quickly become a new favorite among my children. I think one of the bigger draw for them is being able to collect the doubloons, but I know they also enjoy how easy the game is to understand while still challenging them to think and make decisions. Its not always easy to find a game that both of my child enjoy, so this game is definitely appreciated in our house. As a light game to pas 10-15 minutes, I think Dozen Doubloons is a decent choice. It ha a quick set-up and is easy to play. The game lean more on luck than strategy but still offer player various choice to make on their turn. Rules for playing a solitaire variation are also included on the rule sheet, and that is a fun choice for someone who ha a few minute alone and want something to do. As a parent, I also have to appreciate the educational value of this game.

When I first installed it there wa a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service wa great and they updated the firmware over the phone. I do wish the thermostat came with more technical detail a I still had multiple question that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service wa great in answering them. My goal in installing this unit wa to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather. It ha succeeded in doing this. It can be -10 degree out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup. It doe run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat. I like how it learns how long it take your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run time to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it. Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system a it cannot handle large swing in temperature especially in heating mode. I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away. That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle. Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bill by about $30 a month.

I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she wa not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novel are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, a I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it give the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewer gave it 4 or more star and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good.

They would not eat it at all, and in fact found thing around the house to put on top of the plate of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for. The outdoor cat were not much more of fans. They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans. I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it wa left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual. So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cat won't eat it, it's not really worth it. I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them! Perhaps you have le picky cats---lucky you!",0,4

Books_5,5.0,CG,"With Mr. Bryson, it not clear what the author's purpose wa in writing this book. If he is so inclined, it would be to give reader the opportunity to experience a deeper understanding of the family and it influence in the life of the characters. This is a wonderful book for young people to read a they grow up and develop their own life and interests. It also provides a good book for adult to read to their child and their families. I loved this book. It wa written in a very easy to understand style, and I'm not sure why I wa so excited to read it. I like that the story is not over at the end, but the book is written a if it was, and I hope there is a sequel. I also like that it wa written in a little more style, a the character seem more real. I liked how the author used the example of a priest who had a kid with his own problems. I also liked how the author used the word ""con"" to describe the kids. The book wa written in a very easy to understand style, and I wa excited to read it. I have never read a book that wa written in such a simple style, and this book is perfect for that. I will say, I wa very impressed with this book. It wa very descriptive and well written. I read it because I love the John Grisham series and would love to see this one come to fruition.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received ""Whither Thou Goest, I will Go"" by Naomi Dathan for free from [...] I picked this book for one reason: some of it take place in Kansas. Since I am from Kansas, I usually read book with Kansas a the location since most author do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about. This is an incredibly good book. I loved this. It start in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl. Daddy call all the shot in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son. He bought their house, give Jem an allowance, hire their help, everything. When her father get caught with his hand in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move. Seth decides they are going to Kansas. He actually wind up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line. They move and start a new life. One that Seth think he will control and start to call the shots. God ha other plans. Jem is a wonderful fictional character. She is soooo dramatic and funny. She crack me up even when she is being horrible. Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman. Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you. The only thing I did not like wa the format. I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format wa for an i-pad. I have a kindle.

Then the third chapter came along and there were WAY too many people. A whole band of them, at least one of which who had a regular name and then a nickname and that wa just too much. And then the fourth chapter, which wa yet more characters, not just one or two, but a whole passel of them, some of whom are using their real name and also a nickname and it wa just too much. I could not keep all of the character straight. And I know that the book is told from a series of other characters' viewpoint about a couple of characters, but it's just too much.

Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but it pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one. Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam wa so old it wa fuzzy looking this mic work a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic a well a good video quality. The video quality is great but the feature it come with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animation and such.

It work fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove. Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottle and two of the 4oz cartridges. I personally get 11 liter from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent). At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond store and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf cost $20). You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled one behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99. But they promise 16oz cartridge a an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere. Just thinking a reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one. For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridge are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price. I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge. I mean, I can buy some bottle of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cent a liter. You can get some CO2 le than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think. it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products. If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still ha some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottle taking space in the fridge.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE! Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movie in the franchise ha no ground for complaint. However, a a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the book -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the story a they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, a the movie *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative. Fundamental story matter are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it wa explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.) I've a fair eye for such details, so when major detail like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film wa almost unintelligible to me. That take some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort. That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line make more sense, and the gap and flaw of part I are much le distracting so that the OTHER detail of the story-telling can now shine through. Those other detail really are very well done. But the flaw in the film make those finer moment difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.",1,4

That being said, this watch probably doe everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.

There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tell you the date and day of the week a well.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,So I gave three but I wanted to give two stars. This is very expensive first off to not be a great product. Now the sizing I would def size up if you don't like it to be so tight. As the day go on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 week after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kid back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I wa 191! So actually I wa more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fit snug. But the top of it doe roll down and I read other review and hoped it didn't but guess what it roll down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It doe give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it wa softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy suck cause you have to keep the tag on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 day regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well!

If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror film from the 70 based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film look great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fan - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scene where he get to paw his actresses' naked breast every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you? Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babe at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girl like idiot and send them back to their rooms, then shake their head in disbelief when they're murdered two minute later...

I got this book many year ago, and it is accurate when I read her reading for my father, sister and friends. I would say I find her description to be 90% accurate, I think the 10% deviation may be factoring in environmental influence (eg. if she say this person like to dress up or vain, but sometimes if the person is brought up in a family or culture that doesn't support that, or if the person is not physically attractive, they may do the reverse from low self-esteem etc). But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on. I used her book to read several of my girlfriends, it is incredible. The one Suzzane say that are loving, kind natured, nice,- they are indeed very nice and loving! The one she say are cheerful and humourous- they are indeed those who like to laugh and joke!

A cup or 2 of water and a few drop and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper. One every walk. Usually within the first 5 minute of a 30-45 minute walk. Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bag and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository. Two month ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dog in the world. Bag juggle??? Not so much. So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution. It's durable and can't imagine it will take year for the rubber to stretch out and give way. I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes. I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs. I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients. The dog accessory industry is so vast, yet this is one of the must underrated necessities.

The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same.

Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my stride and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy a I dropped it a few time to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 step but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car a it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count step or mile IMO.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I recently loaned this dvd to a young queer who told me they had no idea that homosexuality wa illegal in the United States until 1969. This young person is 22 year old. Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable production of historical American time capsules, ha approached this subject/story of when gay men and woman in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"". This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969. You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story. You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trial suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexual in human history, you'll agree that the methodic effort to obliterate this sector of society ha been continuous and is still alive today. This documentary belongs in every library interested in human history. Not just just gay history.",1,4

It's immaculately detailed and texture are exquisite, especially on the dino's. There are so many detail to point out and explain to your little one a you play together and I'm surprised by how much my little 5 year old loved this set. The bone were especially cool to see. That said, Schleich's Giant Volcano Playset is a vinyl monstrosity that is a chore to put together very cumbersome to store anywhere. The material is soft vinyl and just weighs a ton. It came in 5 or 6 piece and held together by these tiny brittle peg that wa an utter nightmare to assemble. Just a very poor design choice of material. Definitely bad if your little one is prone to throw thing - each of the piece from this set is hefty and will cause some damage. many of the highlighted feature don't work too well or wa embarrassingly underwhelming - ie: the ""exploding wall"" the wall piece had to be assembled into the nook and pressing the button push the piece over - kind of. The flaw here is that the piece are so heavy, the notch of plastic that knock over the wall can barely budge the piece and they pretty much just slide down. The tree snap just hasn't worked yet. The root don't stay agape and the spring snap doesn't really do much. About the only thing that doe work is the Dino jail gate and even that contraption seems over engineered. Flaws aside, the set is very beautiful but alarmingly over priced at almost a hundred dollars. Ouch!

Not only doe she benefit from this but it instantly tell me the temperature in the morning so I know what to wear. Same go with my oldest daughter. I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and show you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glow just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way. It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it last for 72 hour before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trip and voila! I am in the early stage of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already love looking at it and holding it. I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons.

I wa able to figure it out but it would be nice to have a bit more. I did get a disocunt on this product but that did not affect my view on it. I really think this is a nice air mouse.,1,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,These are great patch they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber. I use them on my AR. However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring a it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit. First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod. The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out. They say you can use each cloth 6 time but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the insert get opened up and lose integrity and it make it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened a well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out. I've since become a master of these patch and have used over 65.... meaning I've done about 3 time the swipe or like 200 swipe through my rifles. I recommend the smaller 2 inch patch a they are le likely to get stuck but these are still great. I always pinch close to the insert and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off. I also always check how big it clump up at the base. It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever. Mind you the bullet that go through the barrel ha a small diameter.,1,4

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I started looking for climbing toy for our now 17mth old before Christmas & after hour online, this wa my fav. I planned to buy it for our daughter big Santa gift but hesitated after reading some review about poor safety features...when the priced dropped after Christmas, I'd still not found anything I liked better so I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I ignored the few negative reviews. It is absolutely perfect for our energetic, climbing toddler. She is able to climb the wall with no trouble, the slide is fast & long enough for her to enjoy, she can get a ball into the basketball hoop herself & while the potential is there with most any toy for a child to use it incorrectly and possibly get hurt, under minimal supervision, I see no imminent risk in this toy. (the concern I read were toddler ""diving"" through the hole for football to be thrown through). That particular opening in question doe not hit our child in a place height wise where that is an issue. If she's standing, the hole is around her belly, if she sits, she can peek through the hole, but with the majority of her body safely on the platform, she isn't likely to fall from it. A child, if intentionally trying to dive through, coud get it through it I guess but it doesnt seem very probable. Again, I'm glad I bypassed that info and ordered anyway. I wa also glad it wa not quite a huge a I'd envisioned, it will be easy to move outside in warmer weather. It wa also easy to put together which is a major plus! As a child development professional, I'd also recommend this for building gross motor skills. Definitely recommend this toy, we are so pleased with it...most importantly, so is our child! Alas, she ha something she is allowed to climb on & it satisfies that natural interest for her, safely!",1,4

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"My dog are fairly rough on toy - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both). This ball is not solid, and it is not durable. The ball look exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and ha survived for many month now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around. I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feel exactly how it name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toy I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes. In le than 3 minutes, my dog had begun taking chunk off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I wa paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!! Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the ball are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there wa a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage. So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 star and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",0,4

A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundred of photo before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints. So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons; 1. I had realistic expectation for what I wa getting into. 2. I love photography in all it's shape and forms. 3. Again I had realistic expectation. 4. I'm into fun stuff 5. I'm sentimental for the old days. look at reason 1 and 3 again. some people buy thing with inflated expectation and then get disappointed with what they have. Honestly the photo quality wa way way much better than I expected. The color are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera ha for simple different setting for light condition and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photo are small but that wa a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that make them more precious. In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital camera and our cellphones. We take thousand of photo and print literally zeros. The photo we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Due to the quirk of the marketplace, this wa available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrench in the same series. The one I received wa remarkable in that the jaw were very, very close to parallel. Most wrench of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaw that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut. If there is no room for this, then the jaw need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position. Parallel jaws, or jaw that are wider at the mouth than throat, save the extra steps. The post that hold the worm gear adjuster wa only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance. Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaw will be parallel.",1,4

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I am a special educator and purchased this product to begin teaching one of my student to complete jigsaw puzzles. Most jigsaw puzzle on the market contain at least eight piece whereas this set includes four different four-piece jigsaw puzzles. The limited number of piece make this product a perfect tool for introducing jigsaw puzzles! I will continue to use this product in the future, both for my student and my own child. I have removed one star for two reasons: 1. The illustration on the puzzle leave a bit to be desired. I think that brighter image would be more interesting and motivating for young learners. 2. All four puzzle are within one board (with a frame around each). I have found that this is distracting and confusing for some children. I think this set could be improved by separating the puzzle onto individual boards. One more note: This may be considered a pro or con, depending on how you intend to use the product. The outline of each puzzle piece is drawn onto the wooden frame beneath it. This may serve a a helpful prompt for some children, a they can match the shape of the pieces. However, if you are a teacher or therapist who is measuring independence, this feature may be problematic for you. Overall, I think this is a useful product and would purchase again.",1,4

After all, describing Mann's work seems patently second-hand--""telling"" in creative writing workshop language--and all the narrative commentary effectively take interpretation out of readers' hands.

Two other celebrated signature case are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof wa acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Loved the movie, but it left a bad (director (Besson), and so called visual effects) after taste. The first BIG downer, wa when Lucy wa repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czar henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drug where inside her belly; REALLY? The next blunder wa on the part of the so-called visual effect people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody us it anymore. REALLY? I found the effect (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY? Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, a it wa not well spent on the production. Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it wa a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job.",0,4
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for child and adult who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other product on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yield a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp thread with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all time (until nearing the end), but on every other pas through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto it long edge, every other string rise up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom ha it limitation due to it small size, project that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger piece of fabric. The set come with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet give suggestion about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teach how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripe would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!) Two extra part are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it a is, you may also wish to get: (1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which help speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessory are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with leg crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom.",1,4

While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never ha before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speed and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however. This case's advertising is very, very misleading. The description state that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality. What it actually doe is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever. When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnet in the corner of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratch while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type case provide. I wa sorely mistaken. If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy. If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promise to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid doe not provide secure closure, this doe not bode well for the iPad.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes ha done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes ha managed to take the complex term and concept of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes help u to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he help the reader to see that parenting go way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history. Hughes relies extensively upon example and real-life scenario a he make his points. In doing so, he appeal to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cite the example of a four-year-old who scream with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggle of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concept Hughes lay out are universal for all children, regardless of age. Get ready, though, a Hughes reminds u that the parent's own attachment history greatly affect the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, a how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some question and concept parent should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it play in raising their kids. As a child psychologist who primarily work with foster and adopted child and their families, I continually deal with kid who have their own attachment issue to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done center on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parent I work with, but also for other professionals.",1,4

It's not a warm a the picture would suggest, but it's still nice. The heel is a little loose on me, but not a problem.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and work OK. It also ha a magnetic ball marker that slide off when you press the bottom of it (it ha a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logo or other option offered by the manufacturer). The top end feature an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle cap pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use a a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfer may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many year of use a long a you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it doe it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it open bottle and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods.",1,4

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots wa extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lid -- no question asked. That wa not my experience at all. I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this wa considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lid (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense. (apparently this come with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for) So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it doe not have mm, cm or inch it just tell you how much notch to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feel quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it look just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accent set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she say it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger show the time or cycle through the mode immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she doe not miss her favorite watch it replaced.",1,4

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozen of illustrations, from portrait of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson a a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 year ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionary to establish school in western territory to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremist today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's action did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. "" I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment mean and how it wa intended by our framers, but that stray from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school child and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey [.",1,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool wa going to save me time removing 75 year of paint on my mother in law house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 day later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different color in it 75 years. When using the the stripper I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arm are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cord above the location she wa working. The bungee cord helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beat trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinet in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tool not only in there upkeep but in their performance a well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable doe perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.",1,4

The strainer ha a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leak out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaw of a vice and center a socket over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward.

Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry. And the plot line- every few chapter we find out the ""real secret badness"" that ha been going on- and every time it get revealed more it change again! This is confusing for the reader and feel poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he wa before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing. The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that wa Allegiant, which wa in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book wa available for free at my library and the other book I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short story is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the story themselves, knowing the truth behind everything a revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I wa forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these story for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the story were just okay. While we do learn some new detail about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which cover a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it wa just. okay. Altogether the collection wa a three-star read. There wa nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"There are movie for all moods, for all tastes, for all occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special effects, others the story. In this movie, there's a wide range or aspect that are keep the viewer keenly watching the unrolling of the movie, such that time pass quite quickly, and we get a glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customer of a small 7-11 style store in a major city. William Hurt, play a character that seems quite his own, and natural, a doe Harvey Keitel who reprises the tough-guy with a big heart role. The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies, such a Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION but it doe have a very soft or human side to it, that will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tone of human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyle that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods. The key here, is showing people their human sides, and willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in peace with one another, responsibly. Clearly, these type of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy"" or ""unreal"" story often chosen by Hollywood, that target the below 17 age bracket. Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel. As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my favorite actresses, she really doe a shocking role in this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd that we used to see, in other movie of the same period, such a Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon, or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performance with Judd.

I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cat are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point ha loosened over these 15 months. If it wa just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and it fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

With the wonderful review I've seen here I wa confident that the this one would work beautifully! Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either! It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkle out! Let me assure you, I followed the instruction in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great review I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing! Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same a the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature wa in the 130s in some areas, high 120 in others. My research show that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron put out good steam and will get mild wrinkle out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but wa disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperature are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees. What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it wa after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it ha been brewed not 30 minute or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee. A few minor point include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth. This coffee maker wa bought a one of a few small thing that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon ha past otherwise it would go back.",0,4
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area. Pros: -Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray. -Well built, feel solid. It ha a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant. -Detachable keychain is perfect. It take a good bit of force to detach, which is good. Cons: -Very short range. We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only ha an effective range of about 5 feet. At the end of this 5 foot it ha turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face. But it is still effective a a last resort close range spray. -Button is easy to press. Moving it forward and down doe not take a much force a I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things. This ha not happened yet though. -Extremely limited capacity. the spray canister is TINY. You only get a few short spray out of this, or about a 3 second long spray. This could be a pro for some, a it le likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it. -As mentioned by others it look inappropriate from the top. Someone made some bad design choice on it appearance. While there may appear to be more con than pros, this serf it purpose a an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray. It feel very natural and is easy to aim/conceal. Its always ready if it on your keychain and can be detached if your key are in the ignition. I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button work and the aiming/effective range.",1,4

The main problem wa that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water wa warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature. This new head allows u to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows u to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), ha versatile spray selection although we basically use just the rain shower setting. Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.

The voice acting is improving a well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond a a pretty good Wolverine. Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON: AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many story we've all heard about George Washington. Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myth themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reason behind their origination. While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real source of George Washington quote and lore that Lengel exposes. While some were innocent enough embellishment upon actual event or wholly made-up fiction, the reason behind others are far from innocent. Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the end of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delf into the prevelance of the mythology in today world. Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writing directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myth retain their seeming veracity. Whether taken from forged writing of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirer or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these story in today modern era--usually to serve modern political ends. While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion a to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind: Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify it sourcing. As to the legends? Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the heart of his countrymen."" I give this book FOUR STARS. Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington. Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for story and qoutes being bandied about today!",1,4

And I agree with some that in part one, if it wa not for the title you would not know that the story involved a wolf, but it doe set up the story. Looking forward to reading on.",1,4

I enjoyed this novel a lot, and it gave me a good glimpse of what life can be for a well-off older couple in modern Israel. How they cope with everyday life, family issues, death, mourning, separation, etc. It wa a slow read, but not boring at all. It all happens during an eight-day holiday; Hanukkah. And with the lighting of each candle we get to see how the past and present of this family unfolds. However, I would have liked to know more of some characters, like the couple's son and daughter, for example, or the grandfather, but you still get some hint a to what their life are like. You can pretty much put the puzzle together, or develop the character in your mind any way you want. After all the story revolves around the married couple, Daniela and Amotz, who by the way make a nice couple. The brother in law, Yirmiyahu, is so mysterious and obscure, that you get hooked with him trying to unravel his mind and feelings. Africa seems then the appropriate setting for this man, and all that surround him enhances the mystery. And he doe spice the book a lot. Overall, I think it's a good read, and an enjoyable book.",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Having watched RAI's Montalbano television series (with Luca Zingaretti's outstanding performance a the eccentric inspector), I wa expecting to find the novel familiar and boring. Not at all, not in the least. The TV series excel in giving u the visual feel of the exteriors: the superb cast of delightful characters; and the beauty of Camilleri's fictional town of ""Vigta"" in the fictional district of ""Montelusa"" (actually the Sicilian city of Ragusa, Italy, and surrounding towns). The novel give u what TV cannot, the interiors, the feeling and cogitation of the uniquely unpredictable Montalbano and the reaction of those around him. As Montalbano's faithful (and unusually astute) detective, Fazio, say to himself in ""The Snack Thief,"" his bos didn't become insane, he wa insane from birth. The novel reinforce TV's visual charm and delicious performance with the ""insides"" of the plots, people, and places. In many ways, ""Voice of the Violin"" is the most noir of the series--plot and counter-plot turn the unraveling into a delicious concerto of criminality. One can hear the gear and the arpeggio whirling about in Salvo brain. Camilleri's novel are such a delight to read, I imagine Montalbano's police force colleagues, friend and lovers, even his opponent (criminal and bureaucratic), who lived the plot with him, would enjoy these books. And Montalbano? He'd read the novel and then ask Camilleri, half-serious, half-mocking, ""So, why are you always busting my balls?""",1,4

Controlled either by the Barbie doll remote control or by forehead button when Barbie is riding (though depending on the play area you might be able to bounce Barbie's arm activated infrared signal off the wall and make it work that way), the horse walks, stops, bows, and recovers from the bow a intended. In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting. Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the battery down. I can see some definite additional play possibility if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorn so that they can be made to ram into each other. (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.) Maybe it's another one of those difference between boy and girl things.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is genuine adult fantasy at it finest. I don't mean it is pornographic, though there are sexual element presented within reason. What I mean is that Bakker doe not try to beat around the bush here. His character are flawed, in fact here perfection is defined a the ability to manipulate others. The most likable character are often the weak ones, but it is in fact this weakness that give them compassion for others. There are no definite good guys, even those seeking to battle against the apocalypse are suspect. After all, if you are fighting for such a worthy cause isn't any evil excusable? And if all men and woman are manipulated by their emotions, their past experiences, is it really a crime to use them or hurt them? Are they not machines? These are the question Bakker pose in the course of the novel, which is filled with political intrigue, military conquest, and realistic love stories. What I mean by realistic is that there are no virgin princesses, no knight in shining armor, but rather imperfect people loving each other.

When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago. It is only when Brett's mother pass away from cancer that the layer begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface. To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it come to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who ha orchestrated some of the event Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goal she made when she wa just 14 and a is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the item on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goal penned a a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming element of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scene and seriously swoon-worthy action by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite. All of the event from the first two book come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotion and have to confront many truth about his past. If you're on the hunt for something that feel both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For many year now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tale of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner working of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself ha no shock value. That wa not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell. In Pure Murder, Mitchell tell the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the death of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena. On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girl had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien. Simply because the young, innocent girl were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered. For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me a I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there wa not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims. And, a an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempt by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status a a mean to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girl and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer. If you're up for a good read that evokes so many emotion you feel a though you are on an emotional rollercoaster, look no further than this newest release from Corey Mitchell.",1,4
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keep getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult thing to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their wall breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The character are realistic and well-drawn a always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstance that have surrounded her life. She also ha a softness to her, and I wa on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I wa also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book wa extremely satisfying.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Acorn Media ha provided the DVD with english subtitle which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediment but to foreigner (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with name of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begin with Napoleon III being dismissed and end some time after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fight against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every day life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how time are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper class are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, go to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other woman of her time. With such ""political beasts"" a his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) wa so outstanding a stateman. Love story don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic event occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minute were hardly enough.",1,4

I did get a medium but the one I received wa a bit larger than I expected. I'm sure it's just a manufacturing error. I'm not sure if this is a fault of the seller, or the actual size of the item. I'm sure it's just a mistake that wa made by the manufacturer. I will say, I'll buy this again. If I ever need another size for my cat I'll order a medium.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Two Heart. One Hope. This series is so great! Melanie Dickerson's Fairy tale retelling story mix romance, history, and adventure together. The first book is The Healer's Apprentice. The adaption of Sleeping Beauty. Rose ha been appointed a a healer apprentice at Hagenheim Castle. A rare opportunity for a wood-cutters daughter like her. While she often feel uneasy at the sight of blood. Rose is determined to prove herself capable. Future will mean returning home to marry the aging bachelor her mother ha chosen for her a bloated, disgusting merchant who make Rose feel ill. When Lord Hamlin, the future duck, is injured, it is Rose who must tend to him. As she work to heal his wound, she begin to understand emotion shes never felt before and wonder if he feel the same. But falling in love is forbidden, a Lord Hamlin is betrothed to a mysterious young woman in hiding. As Roses life spin toward confusion. She must take the first step in a journey to discover her own destiny. Although Rose is not a courage a the other book heroines, shes more a bit old fashion compare to other character in other book(perhapsI guess only a little) Bur she ha her advantages, shes kind, she try her best to help her friends, and full of responsibility. She knew she cant be with Lord Hamlin because of the betrothed, so she decided to sacrificed her own happiness rather the good of Hagenheim. Besides all of that, shes a story teller!! How interesting! So for those who concern the shallow characters, I think it better to consider this book a a beautiful fairy tale rather than a contemporary novel. (the book itself is based on the Medieval term, sojust think read the book a Romeo and Juliet, but with happy ending. ) Forget the plot about a damsel in distress, youll find yourselves enjoyed a gorgeous romance story.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I bought this book on the strength of the review I read in Amazon, and all I can guess is that these reviewer are friend of the author because this is not a good book at all. My nine year old daughter and I read it together and she wa very upset by the constant ridiculing of Elsie, the fact that the author had to restate over and over again what a freak she was, a fat a a circus act, can't look at her feet, ha multiple chins, etc. Okay, we get it, she's fat! Now can we get on to the humanity of the child? The other girls, including the narrator, were unlikeable for so long that we almost didn't care when they started to realize Elsie wa a person with feelings. And my daughter wa very concerned with Elsie's mother's abuse of her, and very much hoping the mother would come to some kind of understanding of her daughter by the end. I read the last two chapter before she did, and when I told her that no such event occurred she refused to read the end of the book. As a writer myself, I wa disappointed by the author's lack of a grip on story structure. The character had very little arc, and there were no likeable character to relate to. In addition, the utterly terrifying chapter where the child are kidnapped by a truck driver and taken outside the city limit ha no place in a book like this. Nor did the slap on the wrist outcome by the police. My daughter also wa very confused by this. I respect the opinion of those who liked this book, but I couldn't disagree more.",0,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 year old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply make amazing espresso. Here's my quick note and comparison with the Essenza C100: - The red and black have subtle difference in the spout and capsule release handle. The black ha a chromed handle which make it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality look a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two month so I can't comment on reliability but no problem yet. - The Citiz + milk ha a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it doe integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus. - The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mug which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which wa a major annoyance. - The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better a far a texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer us a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment. - Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally a good a the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that look subtly classy in the kitchen and make an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I have my chain sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear. Otherwise, I touch them myself a soon a they fail to cut uniform shavings. This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwood or two hour of softwoods. If the bar get into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner. You can either carry several chain to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar. I prefer to touch up my own chain because the saw shop usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen. At that rate, a chain doe not last very long. If you touch up your own chain when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandth of an inch.

Cordless grinder don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries. Corded grinder need a place to be plugged in. Either solution limit you mobility. I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge. No electricity required and it easily go in your thigh pocket or field kit. Only one or two stroke per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work. The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",0,4

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it wa up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for month and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the peg don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It us 6 3/4 inch square piece of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refill are expensive. Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turn itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage. Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, peg don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just need some tweaking. Some people say they have problem with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, a well a close it up. In fact, if you overlook the cost of refill or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It let her be creative and not messy, and help her patience level lol.",1,4

We were a little worried about putting toy in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music! Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume ha never seemed to bother him -- he sleep right through it. When he wa still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet. It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy come with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps. We would replay the softest music when the baby wa nearly asleep, the singing when he wa still fussy and needed more distraction. He is one year old now, and he ha learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow). We know he's awake when Pooh start singing! Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turn Pooh on, curl up with his blanket, and go back to sleep. The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it give the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh start to sing (the light fade out a the music softens). Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it! ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he love it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!

I had been considering personality compatibility, but only in a general way. Neither my partner nor I were ""bad"" people, we were just the ""wrong"" people for each other. Dr. Avila's book enables you to ""type"" yourself, how to quickly size up others for their ""type"" and my favorite features, WHERE to meet others of your compatible type and HOW to attract and build relationship with them. These technique apply to BOTH opposite AND same sex friendships. Very targeted, specific information, very rare in dating books.

His theory sound rock solid both from a psychological and common sense point of view. I think that his book settle once and for all the opposite attract, but do they stay together debate.

I never read the comic book or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast. Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purist be damned. The nocturnal adventure of the Hornet and Kato come off more a a fraternity pledge prank than a some altruistic endeavor and I thought that wa a hoot. What would Kevin Smith think? Rogen is ace in my book but the real find is Jay Chou a Kato. Chou's Kato ha a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves. Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" a the head of the Russian mob and he's a equally chilling and funny a he wa in that movie.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I think this will catch me up on my book review over the last week... :-) For some recreational reading, I picked up Dale Brown's Plan Of Attack. This is one of those military war thriller involving the use of hi-tech weaponry to defeat the enemy. Overall, a pretty good read. In the latest episode of Patrick McLanahan's adventures, he's been demoted a rank for once again skirting a direct order given to him for defending a certain area by having and using some offensive weapon when they are attacked. He end up tucked away at a desk top with strict order to mind his own business and just do his job. But he end up getting intel that point to Russia preparation to launch a full-scale nuclear attack on the US. His direct superior won' t listen to what appears to be an outlandish conclusion, so he go over their head and end up facing a court martial. But of course, he's right and the attack take place. His small group of hi-tech commando are one of the few resource left to counter-attack, and he ha to once again disobey some order in order to make his plan happen. Since this book us character that have appeared in other Dale Brown novels, there is not a lot of background character development. If you haven't read the previous novels, you might be a little lost a to why McLanahan is viewed in such a negative light. The story move along at a decent pace, and the different weaponry is interesting to think about. While I didn't see it a a ""can't put it down"" book, I did enjoy the read.",1,4

It ha great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even le if you are in a rush and you skip some of the step that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fitting that attach it around headrest (rear seat and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fitting that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the side of the vehicle a well a between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it doe not slide around too much.

The book start over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She move to Auckland where she ha an IT job and move next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book go along we read a Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book wa the language a being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do thing here and our language. The author used phrase like Kia Ora a hello since the character next door wa Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writer to grasp the different cultural difference and language. Overall though it wa only tiny thing that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up. Honestly, if you are on the lookout for a lovely second chance at happiness and romance story then By My Side is the book for you.",1,4

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I had a sony P-200 camera 7.2mp to replace it with the Canon. My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon camera quite a bit. Both Canon(s) ha more option then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the color are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I wa in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It wa a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and it not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 take better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony take average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it come to day light shots, the Sony win hand down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beat the Canon G-7 in outdoor photo ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) ha more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who want to mess with manual setting on a trip overseas? How many pic will you miss? The Sony P-200 ha a fast boot up a the Canon 850IS and take pic much much faster with the flash when it come to multiple pics. And the sony flat out take better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but it questionable a to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony ha le options, but ha great image quality and ""sony Style"".",0,4

My dog learned to be completely potty trained by 4 month of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go. The 2 flap close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold. This end up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air get in the house. Compare that to the amount of air that come in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside. Here is the drawback. My dog love to grab shoe and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard. I have to go out regularly to pick up the thing they drag out there. I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig hole in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom. I also close the door occasionally so the dog won't bark at neighbors.

I wa also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam. The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry. The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my leg warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot. I have noticed that when something rub against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warning on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuum for about 4 time what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I wa initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minute on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package. Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play game with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minute out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit wa out of it (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one. That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, ha design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% a good a a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% a good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it.

Frequent glitch such a freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS device simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issue with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI a it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional. I really hoped for this newer version to be more satisfying experience than the previous generation but for me that is not the case.",0,4

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I wa interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkle and only occasionally fall flat, usually when he get too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful description and astute retellings of every-day occurrence to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond it setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrade are interesting, but haughty, and their reason for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketch of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many character that are highlighted in their dull everyday routine just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drag down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinge on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that need to be said about that. Still, Franzen's observation on our every day life and interaction are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably ha a good grip on many facet of how our society and culture functions. Twenty year after the fact his comment are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and it blunted intricacy is not worth the time.",0,4

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering. This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that. You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands. They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index finger instead of on all the finger tips. The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all. They also have scratchy tag sewn into the inside at the wrists, which tag are annoying and look difficult to remove. Mine did not come with the clip shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the glove together when not in use. These glove made me think about which finger I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumb and forefinger (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove doe not have enough biosensor tips.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My one year-old son totally love his other Oball trucks, but I admit that I wa a little unsure about this one -- I really didn't think that he would figure out how it works, and I wasn't sure that it would be a ""fun"" a a dump truck or bulldozer. Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I wa making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he wa doing, he wa opening the side up and taking he car out, stacking other thing in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that come down the back for the car to come down from. The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toy we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the side of the carrier or the ramp, their are bit on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edge of the ramp and on both end of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes mean that the door flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out a he get a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now.",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"At it best, this book is an amusing memoir about working a a presidential speechwriter, and a patriotic assessment of what government can do to help people. It doesn't always maintain that level though. List tell his story in roughly chronological order, but there isn't anything like a traditional dramatic arc here -- we get discussion of a good political thing, then a speech about infrastructure, a speech about correctional policy, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a bad political thing, a speech about health care, another White House Correspondents' Dinner, etc. Books by political insider can be fascinating but Litt wa not really an insider. Stories are fueled by proximity to power and to important decisions, but Litt never really got that. He share with u some funny jokes, and these are the best part of the book. A collection of his favorite Obama humor might have worked better than the book we actually got. Yes, we get the story of how Litt got his job in the White House, buffered by his assurance to the reader that he didn't really deserve the job and repeated apology for being white (starting on page 40 when he get an internship with West Wing Writers). Litt doe have some nice turn of phrase in the book; I particularly liked his judgment that the president doesn't play chess, he play whack-a-mole. Many famous people appear in cameos, including an unpleasant run-in with Harvey Weinstein that's a lot more interesting to read now than it would have been a month ago. The Republican party's weird love affair with Vladimir Putin starting in 2014 get called out a well; I suspect we'll hear more about that over time. The book is at it darkest when discussing early problem with the Affordable Care Act website. Was that really so terrible?

Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start. The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane. We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet. The Jump Jet look like a jet but it take off like a helicopter, which mean it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward. It take some maneuvering to get this right, a it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which cause the drift. There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off. Once it take off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode. I wa torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kid were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum. The transformation to jet come suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills. Where before I wa simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward. I took me several try to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land. By the time I finally managed it, it wa out of power.

This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat. I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld. For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop. The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklet I used to use. Overall, it make navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tool to calculate distance/time to a given destination. It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations. The Garmin application the chart run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types. I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit. The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of chart from the CD-ROM. I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worry me a bit a I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling job for ""physique"" magazine before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several year Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol wa a bad producer, Morrissey wa a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actor to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just look so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT ha the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brother who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claim to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he get naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walk out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she give the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, add his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breast or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss.",0,4

The sleeve seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that even thing out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it look just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting. The sleeve are a bit short for my liking; raising my hand up pointing ahead of me result in about 3 inch of arm are exposed. The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I wa worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fit me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt. The area with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeve do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arm move a lot so having a thinner material make for easier movement. Nice. I would not mind if it wa a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again a seen in the product photo). Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable.

No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?""

Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about thing not happening the same way twice. Worthless. Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tale of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many year ago who not only died but lived again and will return? Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film a it wa for me in the book. Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes? ""You're a mouse!!"" Ugh.

Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot wa plausible and so were their reactions. Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other mean of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid. The story begin a they leave their wedding breakfast and the night doe not end well. The next morning come with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he try to manage the escalating problem on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have an orange tabby who ha vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarian who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might a well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it wa canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she wa given. This habit keep her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make thing better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" a we like to call it. The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the hole are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few piece of food which she quickly eats, and then she start nudging again. It take her about 7-8 minute to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomit after she finish her meal. This also help her to get in a little play time a she love to swat it around when it is empty. We plan to get a few extra - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball need to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five star for the ""globe""!!!!!",1,4

Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"(Source: I receieved a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to author Kris Kreisman.) Erin is good at tennis, but while she like it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it doe to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just want to have a normal life. One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin find herself sent back in time to 1970, where she ha the chance to play tennis against her mother. Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time? This wa an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places. Erin liked tennis, but not a much a her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movie with her friend when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she wa getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I wa going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friend in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the price were in the shops! The storyline wa okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she get with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story. The ending wa okay, and it wa good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's action in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed thing in the present. Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story. 5 out of 10.",0,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"First of all, you cannot compare ANY book to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it a if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other author to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either. With that said, this book tell a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that build between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read part of this book and I did get tear in my eye during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he ha for Lisa. The story begin when Lisa go back in time, she meet Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story go on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she know no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story take you by suprise. I wa not expecting an ending like that, but it wa a pleasent ending none the less. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning doe deserve an applaud for this story.",1,4

The story itself is something of a departure from the standard mystery format. The serious issue facing veteran returning from war take center stage for at least the first third of the book, and, after the actual mystery kick in, Spencer-Fleming continues to pull this thread through to the end. The relationship among the character that began in earlier novel in the series are brought forward and developed further. What I enjoy most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way her character remain true to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with issue surrounding re-entry into her life a pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effect of the war in which she ha just been engaged have changed her and altered her reality. She ha the same issue a other soldier who return from combat. But Clare is a priest, and donning her collar, along with all it attendant expectations, make dealing with those issue that much more difficult. In her construction of the dialogue, the author make Clare's very human struggle apparent and sympathetic. Other writer here have reviewed the story in greater detail. A lot happens in ""One Was a Soldier."" There is significant progress in the story for all the characters, but there is plenty left on the bone for the future.

Montgomery ha returned from his exile with a score to settle. Hoping to gain redemption and ruin those who had wronged him, Montgomery venture into a seedy underbelly. Bridget Crumb, Montgomery's newest housekeeper, ha secret and her own agenda.

Her story have a great flow to them and this one wa no exception. I wa hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book. I had a few problem with some of the finer detail of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and wa supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it wa irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic fact about the era that he wa visiting. He kept trying to open thing voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when thing were invented. Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 year and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that. I tend to think of all of these detail when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies. Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples. Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution. It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time. The plastic is flimsy, the handle pop off while you are turning it, and the suction cup on the base are weak. One of their selling point is ""the spring loaded blade peel the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keep popping off that mean a lot of stopping & restarting. They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box. Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion. The peeler doe work...just not very well. In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollar more.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"The work light work OK so far. It charge via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port doe not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light. The three moving light can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degree to the surface and cannot concentrate all four light on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the side more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down. The battery life wa relatively good so far, and it charge rather fast, too. When the battery get low, it turn off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few second to find a charger. It doe not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery. The most irritating thing is that it ha one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only light up the end, a a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it light up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the side and direct them away.

Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and ha a powerful motor (you could probably juice rock with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that). The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inch in diameter.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr wa extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine a far a I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped. When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two day (NY to NJ) and there wa no additional charge. I wa thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It wa in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corner (and under the corner) wa severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptop possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop wa in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box wa damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box wa in great condition. Hmmm.... Anyway, it wa listed a used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 star instead of 5. Highly recommend!! Great experience overall.",1,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, a part of the Amazon Vine program. However, I always try to review item a if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them. With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for. It is made of press board. It doe seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability. The hardware is very nice, and look expensive. The finish on the press board look nice a well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood. The drawer glide easily. I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting bracket with this chest. The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children. It never hurt to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddler bedroom fastened to the wall. This is not a large piece of furniture. According to the specification here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inch high. I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but a a child get older, it will not have enough storage space.",0,4

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,I probably should give this 5 star because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She love ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really show interest in at all. They also are just the size I wa looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch a sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four star wa the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tear them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one wa missing piece one of the wicker ball wa just in piece in the bottom of the box and a couple piece of the colored wood were laying in the box a well. She already tear them up pretty quickly and having it already missing piece definitely make it last even le time. It wa aggravating to me because the toy came in a box from Amazon with other item I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toy which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one wa damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;),1,4

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Very nice set of pencils, they color beautifully in adult coloring books, especially for very intricate coloring. However if coloring larger areas, they do take a lot more time to blend so start/stop line are not visible, but it can be done. (I'd recommend using Primascolor pencil for coloring book with mermaids, fairies, ect...) I tested them against Crayola, Prang, Rose Art, and Prismacolor Soft Core Pencils. They color so much smoother than the Crayola, Prang, and Rose Art. They definitely are not a replacement for Prismacolor pencils, they are still a step below them. The pencil sharpen very nicely just using the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener (it's the green one). Where a for my Prismas I have to use the black sharpener. I have the 72 pencil set, about 20 of the color are very close to each other, almost duplicate even. It could of easily been a 48-50 pencil set if they rearranged the color included in the 48 pencil set they offer. I did purchase the metallic 12pk set a well which I'm waiting to be delivered.
