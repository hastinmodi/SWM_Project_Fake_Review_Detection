Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"This movie is basically two people who are trying to make a living. One is a person who is self-conscious about the fact that his life is around him, and the other is a person who is afraid of him. Both of them have some kind of problem with the fact that they are a woman and have to do it because they can't work. I think that if you are a woman who ha to deal with the fact that you have to work, then you will have to do something about it. You have to work, and you have to work, and you have to work. In the beginning, you are a woman and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work.

You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head. When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface. There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast. When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece. And you can make additional bolt to mount the same clamp at different place simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder. It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.

The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon come to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master. Review - 2/5 When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the character are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it doe have it's moment that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He ha some funny one liner and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effect aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it wa made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actor or director ever becoming a big name. None of them ha made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it.

This is a new series by The Brothers is a learning tool a well a an entertaining well illustrated with photograph book for youngster who are curious. It is meant to be shared, a starting point for parent/child interaction in learning and opening the field for questions. This book deal with the number 2 and to give an example of how the book is constructed, the first page start with a photograph of adult hand holding baby feet. The wording is We have only two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ear Did you know that? There are 27 bone in the human hand and that only ape hand have a similar structure. Picture, facts, and then further information make this a very interesting format. Some of the other 2 page present eyes, set of teeth, gender (the note courageously mention the combo hermaphrodite), two name for autumn, two political parties, side of a coin, two kind of pandas, number of hump on a camel, the two World Wars, two million flower for a bee to make one pound of honey, number of day human can survive without drinking, number of muscle in a cat ear = thirty TWO, and so forth. The amount of information begin at an (hopefully) obvious level and then disseminates into all manner of topic a the above list suggests. As The Brothers say, Read it the book to your children, speak to them about it and explain it to them. This is one of the more creative and fun book for families. Highly Recommended.

I found it to be enjoyable, interesting, with an ability to keep me interested and engaged. I wa surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limit the defensive ability of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what make it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version a well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spot for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning wa what the rest of the world wa doing while this went on in southern England? The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It wa pompous and self-important, and wa not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously wa merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of it own. The writing style wa excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional.

First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertone in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meet a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That say it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story. In fact the person go to Japan to find the answer to the death he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two part of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) ha lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compare her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and give a very sharp clue a to her mother's death. Also she ha been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deal with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.

When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip wa clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coat and two day of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuff with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint.

Not very pleased with the quality of the camera or the screen resolution but it doe what she want it to do. The color are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at picture or watching a video and the picture from the camera are very grainy. This wa a disappointment to her because she like to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures. This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon. Maybe they don't sell it anymore. The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games. The touch screen is sensitive enough. We only had one issue after a few hours. It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message. Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly. Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it wa a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad. The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place. Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet. For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed. In short if you want to just browse or play game buy it. If you want to take picture and watch video I'd look else where.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The mystery in this book wa a decent and solid a any in the series, but I found it overshadowed by Hamish's bizarre decision when it came to women. Granted, he's never been particularly successful, but at this point it's been drawn out so far it's becoming painful. In this case a part of it wa necessary to the plot, but it still had me cringing to read it. I think this is the part of Hamish's personality that I have difficulty pinning down, despite having read most of the book in the series. Perhaps watching the BBC television series further muddled the waters, because the character there wa slightly different than the man I envisioned through reading the books. His attitude towards woman and relationship seems slightly off (not in any bad way, but in a 'sometimes old fashioned' and 'sometimes suddenly very modern' way) and it throw the character out of balance. In truth, I'd prefer the series much more if the love life aspect wa dropped more by the wayside. There have been some book where it wa merely an aside mentioned, and I wish more were that way. Because the series ha gone on for so long, and we've gotten to know some of the character so well, it's in danger of slipping more into a soap opera than a set of neat, tidy little mysteries. Compared to some of the other book in the series, this one wa a little lacking. However, compared to a lot of other mystery series, it wa still fairly decent. I'd say dedicated fan of the series should definitely read it, but newcomer really should start at the beginning to really understand the dynamic of the relationships.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Reading through the reviews, people kept on saying about how the ""No more than four of any one card"" is a lie, but I decided to take a gamble on this anyway. I am pleasantly surprised. I sorted through them, most card are 2X, a lot of them are 1X, some are 4X, didn't notice any card that were more than 4 of a kind, but I might have missed some. Total number of card received: 1139 (1138 English, 1 Russian) Color breakdown: White: 204 Green: 189 Black: 152 Blue: 202 Red: 180 Artifact: 63 Multicolor: 41 Eldrazi: 1 Non basic Land: 4 Land: 100 (20 of each color) Token: 2 Quality breakdown: Common: 877 Uncommon: 148 Rare: 5 (1 of the rare is signed by the artist) Foil common: 2 Do not buy this if you are an advanced player that's looking for card to use for tournament play. Many of the card are not tournament legal. I personally like it better because I like to collect some of the older card for their artwork. Some old card date back to Ice Age (1995), 5th edition (1997) etc and range to the new one like M11 and Scars of Mirrodin (2011). I like to recommend this but remember you don't know what you are actually getting. They are mostly common and some card are old and a few are not in the best condition.

If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. The problem is in the presentation. Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, a Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in it audience; of the six member of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit. No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in it way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I found this book exciting from beginning to end. There are those who thought the first section long and boooring, and I disagree. I honestly wanted to know all I could about the principle figures, and author Laura Hillenbrand obliged. The people she introduces to u are real, breathing, fleshed-out people with concern and agenda we can understand, thanks to her detailed expositions. We can see the extravagant extrovert entrepeneur Charles Howard who becomes Seabiscuit's owner, the quiet, non-smiling trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper should be great in the role), the tough but literate jockey who ha a life filled with his share of misery ahead, and above all, the unlikely horse who captured the public's imagination and inspired more column of newsprint in 1938 than did Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, or Mussolini. We get an understanding of the times, still depression-era with cloud of war gathering, and why a hero to ease the extreme stress of the time wa necessary. We learn much of the unpretty side of the life lived by the jockeys. We get the flavor of bordertown Tiajuana in the day of U.S. prohibition and anti-gambling legislation. But the absolute highlight for me were Ms. Hillenbrand's colorful race descriptions. I wa able to picture the running of each important race and these description were suspenseful. In fact, Laura Hillenbrand's ability to keep the reader on the edge of one's seat is a welcome treat in non-fiction. Now if you're just not at all interested in horse or horse racing, you're probably not even reading this, and if you are, I'd suggest getting the book from the library.

When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their private are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chance of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high.

This is not a caricature of the social status of the average American, a many Americans are naturally drawn to be socially intelligent, but rather, a caricature of the social status of the average American. So we learn that the giver, Joe, ha been driven to a new town by the poverty of the region, and ha no friend or family who will let him move on to a new home. The novel is very clever, with Joe engaging in a very interesting discussion of what it mean to be a ""socialite"". He is also a good storyteller.

The story of Chloe and Noah wa complicated to say the least and it hooked me in.

She cared for Noah. She wa excited to get a new start. She wa happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex. Leading Male Noah wa sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician character in novel nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms. Romance I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship wa fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more.

I'll give you a hint: it look amazing. The detail is wonderful. Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure ha very good articulation too. And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt ha the classic bat emblem too. Like all the other one in the series, it come with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards. The figure is perfectly able to stand on it own, since the foot are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic. Like the other figures, this one ha no accesories. Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadget in the old series. I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray. No matter. The figure on it own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars.",1,4
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"This is a perfect first time purchase and the material are good. The only reason I gave it 4 star is that the plastic part are very heavy, and the cover is very large.

I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sight are very well made and easy to sight in. The front sight ha a nice metal plate that is very easy to attach and remove. The rear sight is very easy to attach and remove. I also like the color and the grip. It is very comfortable and comfortable. I wish the grip wa a little larger for my hands.

It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone wa sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud ha been playing football for 10 year and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interaction together and the building of their relationship. It wa genuine and believable for me. Nothing wa rushed or forced. I wa able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football ha reached the playoff and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It wa a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I wa missing something somewhere.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"My theory is fiction writer (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists. Every psychiatrist I know ha gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis. Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies. If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude. Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption. We are introduced to each character in term of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional. (What is Schickler's own personal flaw? Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss). Each of these flaw is at the core of Schickler's stories. The story focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex. We eavesdrop on each character fantasy and insecurities. (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy). One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women. Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious. The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practice that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's date had better be suspicious of nice diners). In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with name changed to protect the innocent. It's a book about loser scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling woman allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problem at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I wa going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It match with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What difference it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This make it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It wa an A+ idea and really make your life easier. It also make it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads. The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it look at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element. Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it work perfectly.

I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb look exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb a consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same a my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not a bright a the old G7 at 7200 lux. But it acceptable. It come on instantly and ha a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It doe have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several foot onto my dark brown granite countertop, it wa mostly unnoticeable.

What a fantastic idea, they took something that wa needed by million of woman (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of color here on Amazon a well a their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small wa just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumption on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big. This is very well made and ha built in clear silicone ring - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I wa hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture... This work well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed a any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands). It may even hold a cell phone, but I haven't tested it with anything that weight. Overall, I really like these! Adorable (and sexy), and practical. I like mine and recommend them for others.

I have hardwood floor with a good amount of dog hair and it doe a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the roller and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what make it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It pick up debris well, get into tight spot and corners, get fairly low so that you can get a good way under bed and couches. EDIT: 6 month later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 room (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It pick up most thing well. It work well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger thing take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake a much a possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charge quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of it total charge in the time I've had it.

The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide. In this book I wa able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and le based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice part of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that pass Lance wa more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feel like he ha the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desire because Tide support him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion. Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's want and need but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional need any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way. Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make change and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future book in this series.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I really liked this knife when I first got it. Pro: It wa my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it. Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle. Very sturdy and ha good texture to keep it secure in the hand. Con: Steel did not keep much of an edge. Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once. Usually it just got in the way). Too much play in the blade. Others have mentioned this in their reviews. But even after tightened there wa a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily. But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assist in opening) broke. And since that happened, the lock doe not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected). So now this thing is going in the trash. The blade literally just flop back and fourth. I do not even trust it to use a a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable. Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife. I thought Gerber wa good quality. At least they seemed to be when I wa growing up. But I will probably not own another one. Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half. EDC tool should be more reliable.

Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse. It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already.

But if you are looking for a comparable replacement for your 80 or 90 VCR, you will most likely be disappointed. This LED display, for one thing, is lacking. While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only display the word ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc. There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times. The VCR also doe not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model. My advice is this: If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fill that role nicely. 120 lumen is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding item in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use a a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yard while medium power in excellent for situation where you don't need 120 lumens, such a walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for task such a unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe a I don't have much use for it. The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasion and scrape to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, a it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it click for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on. Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light make a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear. Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable.",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rate a four star a related to my needs. 1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snap onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stay in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out. 2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place. 3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go. 4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry. So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negative to this product. 1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issue getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up. 2) The hose need to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two opening are not labeled. 3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger. I can think of several past household situation - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",1,4

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy. As charming and quirky a Gail Carrigers Soulless series, CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES delf back into all the way that society, science, and magic can collide. Sophronias perspective on manner and intelligence gathering is a fantastic window into this world, which is a interesting for the social dynamic a for the dirigible and mechanimals. From the outside, placing a spy training facility inside a Victorian finishing school would seem like an odd juxtaposition, but even new reader will quickly orient themselves to this mix of familiar historical setting and completely original world building. Sophronoia read a a genuine teenager (though historical gloss make her seem older than her 14 years), and her youth is a key element of what make her compelling a a heroine. The choice that face her are relatable, from budding love to jealous rivals, and each one of these challenge foreshadows larger life issue she will face one day. As a lady intelligencer, Sophronia is learning how to blend with society, but will she also internalize the limitation and boundary of the peer around her? Will she submerse herself in the cold, calculated, ignore-the-collateral-damage world of intelligence gathering? Or will she find a new path for herself, both professional and empathetic? While the intricacy of the mystery in CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES kept me glued to the page, it will be that larger question of Sophronias fate that will keep me coming back for more. Witty, charming, and brimming with potential, I cant wait to see the woman Sophronia is growing into.",1,4

Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture a well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 foot which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences. There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angle are excellent which is one of the reason we choose plasma over LCD. The audio speaker are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV doe have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it go away a the TV warms up. Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.)

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have mixed feeling about this book, the thing that I liked were also the thing that I didn't. Maddie for example, wa this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what make her such a complex character to read about. If this wa reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse wa so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that wa choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference between the last two book by SM and the earlier one in this series, one of the problem being that there have been huge break between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore. I gave the book 4 star because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it wa written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly, the part where the conflict with his own family wa not explained enough, I wa able to take at face value a I would not want to read page and page about the extremely violent circumstance of those times, a couple of sentence thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance a I would like to have read from SM.",1,4

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I wa kind of hoping these would replace my current brown everyday work shoe (Doc Martin-looking Sketchers oxfords). They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather. More of a spring/fall shoe. They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper. The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather. This make them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all. I deemed them to ""fit a expected"" because a a 7.5, the 8 were a little big on me. Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes. They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide). At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them. Update: I should also emphasize that the sol aren't very supportive. They sort of have a ""barefoot"" feel like 5-toe shoe or minimal running shoe -- not a bad thing at all, but might not work for some.

Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.). Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system. I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal end with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inch apart in the upper back of the filter housing. Place the S hook through the hole and hang of over the lip of your tank. Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filter work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meet the uptake tube.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your device and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who ha used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minute on the xda forum to find the instruction for how to root, spend another couple of minute performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable. I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and application launch immediately. A couple of note if you're one of those people who ha been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market. Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It add amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeve for 10"" tablet (I also got one of those). I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods. Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks.

I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.) The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far. I really like the counter that keep track of how many time the machine is used, at first I thought it wa an unnecessary feature, but it really help to know the cat are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge. I have two cat and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it. I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it! I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine. When my item wa delivered, it wa not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on. Needless to say the box wa beaten and looked taped together when it arrived. In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cat decided not to use it. Box work just a I had expected, no complaint (although it is kind of loud, but what do you expect?!) I'm very satisfied with this product.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I reviewed this movie after seeing it in theater and gave it 3 1/2 stars. It ha grown on me after seeing it a second time. I think it is on par with the first film, but the FF movie series suffers from too much comedy! I like comic book film to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our hero seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing get hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's state ""That Smarts""! and peel Reed off the wall like a cartoon! Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior look much better this time around and so are the effects. The Silver Surfer is a welcomed addition to the franchise and his FX are done extremely well! I know a lot of people were disappointed in Galactus being presented a a cloud but, I think an armor clad giant with a purple helmet would look ridiculous floating though space eating planets. The film is a bit short, but over all it's fun and capture the essence of the comic book. This film is not perfect, but it is entertaining for fan of the series. I hope there will be a third entry in the series. I would like to address some problem with the Thing. I can see cross over's galore in the future and the Thing a he ha been presented in these film wouldn't last one second with the Hulk if they ever do battle in a live action film!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statement of fact introduced into this book are true.

Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that life only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain? Here is a whole universe of knowledge which come handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival. Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe. In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money. She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands love. She ha learned to love a child, and the child is dead. Was it an accident? Because of what Smilla know about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it wa not. Smillas exploration into what really happened lead her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunge into freezing water, and lot of explanation about ice. This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees. Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland. As I wa thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floe of northern Greenland where the novel played out it last pages, I began to see a few area in the plot where Hoeg wa skating on pretty thin ice.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to it end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end. The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flick cranked out several time a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the character and a fluid narrative that take center-stage. As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenge of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonist do a fabulous job of coming across a outsider among their peer never quite trying to ""fit in"". In what begin a a harmless goof, one of them find herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character role in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role. Thrown in are other interesting caricature of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids. Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closure so some may take issue with how it all turn out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feel more real this way.

A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equal or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior. She run away from home to escape marriage and he run away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it wa rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of set of halogen track light year ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb. But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other light and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulb when it come to lighting up my room, and it's just a good a one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white wall and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulb they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase.",1,4

That said, about medium setting wa way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedal fixed relative to the crank while unloaded. The adjustment wa easy and the setting indicator wa clear. Some folk prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that make sense if you are always using cleated shoes.

They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajama or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bump and to keep my bare skin off the plastic. It doe work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble. I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it come with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my day of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that. I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative.

Comfort is the word that is synonymous with the Rockport brand and these shoe are no exception. They are nice to slip into and nicer to walk in.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"This doorbell system ha a LOT of potential. What I've found, though, is that it doe NOT seem to like cold weather. I went through two set of battery in two months. I learned and bought a large set of battery through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather month (I live at 5,000 foot elevation). Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous. After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of battery in under a month, they replaced the unit. The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut. In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine. But when the battery start to go bad, the doorbell will go off on it own randomly, many time in a short span of time. There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guest :( I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it. The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chime are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guest in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door. NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that say ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell. Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell a they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blend in to the white paint on my house.",0,4

Along the way we get fascinating peek into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian view on mental health and quite a few other asides. I am not sure that this is a book so much a a long magazine article (think New Yorker style).

Surely didn't expect the bubble to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again. After seeing review about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.

So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it wa good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrink it'll be fine), the sleeve were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL. So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect. Which means, once washed, these sleeve will be far too short. Actually, I bet these *are* sleeve for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves. I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be? Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nub for arms?

Well, while it store information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it take anywhere from 5-15 second for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it load fully, which can take a much a 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rate should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it take about an hour. I can transfer file between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I wa searching for a backpack to take my dog with me on bike rides. This one wa more expensive than the other options, but it is well worth it. The sport sack is so well made - substantial canvas fabric, mesh air vent for those hot days, and two pocket for stashing key and leash and things. Plus my boy love it! At first he wasn't thrilled about being stuffed into it, but now he get all excited when I put it down on the floor because he love coming along in my rides. He is always very content and fascinated by the scenery. To put him in it, I place the unzipped sack on the floor and insert one paw into the appropriate leg opening. Then I grab his other leg and start to lift, which cause him to put weight on the first leg so I can pull the sack up on that side. Then I insert his second leg and clip the bag behind his neck. Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It help to cinch the strap and being the bag high up on my back. For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length wa 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium.

No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it. Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous.

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"About a witless and not-horrifying a you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversation about their pointless life and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildup to climax that don't arrive, and repeated scene of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghost and attack each other"" but it wa just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie. Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one mess up everything: A Civil War setup go nowhere; scene are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sound lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house look neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversation mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about character you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it wa over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there wa a demon in it. The photography wa actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but come across a more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart.",0,4

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I liked it. I didn't love it. After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There wa an entertaining main character, lot of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem wa that I didn't connect with the main character. Harry wa so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what wa inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry. On a couple of occasion in the book, Harry claim to struggle with his choices. He want to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draw him toward darker things. I know about these struggle because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much a a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation wa lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy. Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away.

But after putting them on and looking closer, the three finger tip (first two finger + thumb) are indeed made of a different material that provided a high degree of responsiveness on our iPad. Score one for the gloves! Alas, I had le luck with my iPhone, where my thumb is needed for typing. There is a seam that run across the top of the thumb exactly where my finger come into contact with iPhone, rendering the ""Capacitive Material"" useless. WIth a slight roll of my thumb, or shifting of the seam, I could get them to work properly. But definitely a design flaw. 2) I ran an errand first thing the next morning - about 25 degree outside. Based on the knit material, I wa le than surprised to discover these glove lack sufficient warming property to qualify is ""Cold Weather Gear."" I would not recommend these much below 45 or 50 degrees. 3) The material is highly porous with skin visible through the material. There were loose thread a well, straight out of the package.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Any praise for Gaiman's The Graveyard Book seems anticlimactic after it being awarded the prestigious Newberry Award, but I couldn't read this book without saying a few word about it on the offhand chance that one or more of my reader may have been hiding under a rock for the past few months. I passed this book up actually, the first time I saw it. It seemed like a book for younger audiences, and it is, but when I picked it up a month or so later (peer pressure's a serious bitch) I found it entertaining myself. It tell the story of Nobody Owens, a toddler who escape to a graveyard when his family is murdered, and follows him up to his teenage years. He's raised by the ghost who live in the cemetery and ha a variety of adventure involving ghouls, a werewolf, a dead witch, a dance between the living and the dead and more. Most of the chapter in the middle of the book could be stand-alone short (and bedtime) stories. The end of the book, Nobody's confrontation with his family's killer, is over about a quick a it begins, and that's a bit jarring, but forgiveable because that's not what the book is supposed to be about anyhow.

And what's more. I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice. He doe ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal. His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc. These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films. ""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad wa just Will Smith himself. Well, wait a minute. It's not that I don't like Will Smith. I just don't like any of his films. Any actor could have replaced him in all those film of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me. I guess I just don't care for his choice in his movie career.

Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of year ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in. Set in an alternate post-WWII America that ha been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focus on five or six character whose story never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novel feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapter or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matter is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four term a President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these element fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.

However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same condition if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping. Overall, this bag look great, feel comfortable, pack away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm. I would recommend to a friend a a backpacking bag.",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man want to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just ha to have her in his life? And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eye ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good move along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life get threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H save the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three month later...either way. Too soon.

Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today wa the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof. I finagled the strap to attach on both side via the metal attachment holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stay out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good. The bag is much larger than I figured it wa going to be. It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'. The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually work and when you unfasten it it make that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it. Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick. Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartment and the main compartment. In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff ha it's setback too though. For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ordered for Mom and she love it!

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speaker on the 15"" (the 13"" speaker are good but not a rich and bassy a the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine. Let me get what I don't like out of the way: --wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which ha such outrageous screen resolution) --wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lb (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines) And that's it for the wish list. Now what I absolutely love: --the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac. --backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hand on the surface of the textured aluminum area) --fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management --first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair). This give the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity. No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chew through EVERYTHING. The only toy she ha yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she love squeak toy and I wa looking for something that would actually hold treat and make her work for them. It took about three week for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy wa still functional, and wa actually longer than I wa expecting that particular leg to last a she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, wa still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it take to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it wa played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs. SUMMARY: PROS: -Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dog -Multi functional a chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well a float and what not) -kept my dog occupied when filled with treat or kibble (kibble worked best actually) -cute -squeaker isn't too loud CONS: -not indestructible for big chewer -the stupid leg (They're it's weakest point) -the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in it squeaking ability (but wa interested for food purposes) -Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",1,4

Books_5,3.0,OR,"To being with, it's very important that we pay attention to the exact subtitle of this book-this is ""vampiric"" erotica, not ""vampire"" erotica. While all of the story revolve in some way around parasitic characters, only a few of them are the classic warm-thick-blood-sex vampire erotica. Most of the story are at least creepy, and a few are quite scary. As wth any collection of short stories, not every story will be to every person's taste, a you can see from the review here. In particular, the story ""The Dripping of Sundered Wineskins"" seems to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it opinion. Personally I loved it. I enjoyed all of the straight vampire tales, especially, of course, Neil Gaiman's excellent opening tale, ""Snow, Glass, Apples"". Other notable vampire story were ""Ceilings and Sky"", Whispers in Walled Tombs"", ""First Date"", and ""Bloodlight."" Unfortunately, though, there are several story I hated, too. ""Armies of the Heart"" wa one, and I really, really hated ""When Memory Fails"" and ""The Fly Room."" Eyeball-sucking? Little mouth hanging around where they shouldn't be? Yeuch, no thank you! And ""Bela's Plot"" I unfortunately just did not understand. Were there actual vampires, or just sadists? All in all, the book is worth it if you like spooky stories, and many of them are written in a slow-moving and descriptive style that give them an erotic feel, but if you're looking for Vampire Erotica, you won't find much of it here.",0,4

Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her a this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes ha to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that come to her in the night in her dream and ha his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what wa so funny.

I'm folding the top down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher sock for protection against insect bites. For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy. Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good! Construction: You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness. There's a ribbed band that go completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toe and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside. So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable. You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the sock too hot or bulky. Materials: With year of experience knitting sock myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers. These sock exceed that, and should wear very well. These are my favorite store-bought sock yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf. You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw detail and ONLY this product. I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 a favor for friends. Now in it packaging, already I notice the plastic part wobble... because they are extremely thing. The card measure 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that need to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flap of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart. The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letter and tape (but not bubble wrapped package or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not a a solid a an actual switchblade or letter opener and flop around quite flimsily. The folded card will fit in most wallet where credit/gift/debit/reward card usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 second for an average person to assemble. Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or a favor to friends, you might a well go for it, for the great price these are offered.",0,4

They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rug are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have place it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She ha been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it a a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle wa sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she wa able to brace the impact on her head and body!

If somebody help me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

It ha strong element of abuse and wa very dark at time but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were time that it wa hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So a you hear in so many instance of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger a the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she know she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choice to not feel the pain that wa inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel see the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meet he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many element of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he doe this because he ha experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of book because there are ALOT of reference to books, both subtly and not but he weave them into the story beautifully.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choice for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I wa initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful a a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 week of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screen show an appropriate level of detail and the display ha excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright condition under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy a well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I wa surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used le than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about a advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on a you need it because it get a fix in about 15 second if you haven't moved too far.",1,4

Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her a well. It's a if his devotion ha been one sided for so long it's become bitter.

It's not heart & flowers, you're the love of my life kind of sex. More like angry, you can get the hell out of my life kind of sex. This only prof to confuse an already confused Keira. This story center around a woman trying to grab her bearings. Everything that she thought wa real is being stripped away. She no longer ha Jimmy, her man, or Kevin, her sounding board; her cupcake business is in ruins. Her life at the end of her twenty isn't turning out so great. Without giving too much away, this story ha me on the fence. I liked it, and yet I found myself not really enjoying the heroine. Let me clarify; part of me liked her and understood her, and yet part of me wanted to slap her and tell her to man the heck up. She needed to open her eyes.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it wa the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the show a the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooder that ha made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy. Since I have no other season with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar prof her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carry the show on her shoulders, yet carry that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohort are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan play Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon give Xander, a loveable loser, dignity. Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun. The twelve episode stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratcher in the mix. The first two set up the series and it character very well. Some of the favorite included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally help solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dream enter reality. One particularly odd episode wa ""The Pack"", where hyena seem to enter a group of student a they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it. Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I wa pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, a they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demon and the trial and tribulation of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience. I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!",1,4

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulb I bought three month ago, one is already dead. (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!) Even before that, there were a couple of flaw that really bothered me: - Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub. I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings. With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k light (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k. I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time setting pressing. (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!) - Pairing mode is too easily triggered. I have a toddler and on multiple occasion now, she's managed to put the bulb back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub). GE Link bulbs' pairing process wa an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggle like we have with the Sylvania bulbs. - The dimmest setting isn't a dim a Hue or LIFX bulb (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled). - SmartThings Routines that trigger change to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concept - and I believe it is a good introduction. The instruction are not great, good enough but not great. The instruction describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expense - but there isn't really a winner of the game. Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expense but the instruction don't state the first one to get there wins. Each player get a ""financial statement"" a their game card. During play, each player gain passive income source and expenses. The player keep track of their passive income v expense on the financial statement. When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win! The game doe a good job of reinforcing this concept and also doe a good job providing example of passive income source (rental property, owning a business, etc.). It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he need on the next turn in order to win.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've read a lot of new adult romance book lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ. I think anyone who read a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes. We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know? To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too. This book is definitely that. Right from the start, the entire thing catch you. I honestly didn't expect what I wa reading, but I liked it. Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more. Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too. There's a lot going on in this book. The character are interesting and realistic. I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially. I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book. Jenn's struggle are oftentimes something I think a lot of u can relate to, also. Maybe not exactly, but the idea and concept behind them, you know? I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be a realistic wa it was, I wa impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it. One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that. Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on it own. I can't wait to read the second part!",1,4

The toaster sensitivity button allow for a range of setting (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it doe anything other than toast the item inserted. The slot are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice. The problem? It toast one side crispy, the other luke-warm.

He can't get job in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone. Greg Kinnear star a Bob Crane. His performance is excellent for it depiction of the shallowness of the man. And Willem Dafoe, a John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, give an outstanding performance. Carpenter work for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, set Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly. Crane get hooked into this lifestyle and this lead to an inevitable violent outcome. The script is somewhat lacking but the actor still manage to get into the skin of the characters. However, it make these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never capture the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the time wa gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off a a lightweight bimbo. The DVD had some long extra about Bob Crane's murder.

There are also clip of mini interview with the people with whom he ha worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth. Although Mia Farrow is covered, she doe not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter year ago. Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clip presented here. It wa very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbit about what else wa going on while making them. Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which wa unknown to u before.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it look like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely set thing up for a continuation and that mean more of my favorite fictional couple! Locked and Loaded pick up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feeling for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she want him"" which make him somewhat defensive. Or a Christina describes him ""Michael wa like a half-tamed dog, a likely to turn on you a he wa to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just a slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization a usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish say a much about their individual growth a it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina find that her plan of joining the BN to be trained a a hacker doesn't work out exactly a she had anticipated; and Michael still ha the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story end on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it wa too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters.

(I have 4 pair of Danskos which have lasted for 10 year and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes.",0,4

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased wa for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in le than 2 minutes. The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan us round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I wa able to get the second ring in a bit easier. As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillow on your ear and more importantly add some distance so your ear are not resting directly on the grill. From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound change using the new pads. The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrade for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those ring before you can mount the earpads.",1,4

My beagle pup ha loved this since the day she joined our household at eight weeks. The other dog have enjoyed the larger size all their lives, but this one is just the right size for my Buffy. It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat. She will work on it to get the food out. When she give up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher. Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight. It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.

We'll see how they hold up, but I plan to wear them everywhere. They have an insert that reminds me of one I used to buy for high heels. It ha a small arch support that I didn't expect and should make the shoe more comfortable for long period of walking.

Thermo wa registering over 700 degree inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel ha held up very well through many hot fires. I made one slight modification by installing some rail for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot.

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watch - some at price point between $1K-2K. Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova ha done with this 300m Sea King! The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful. The orange highlight look great against the black dial. And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold. It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch. The top of the bezel is brushed, and look REALLY nice. It ha a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also. The rest of the case ha brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look. The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown). Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch! The case back even ha a cool little logo on it. The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watch is superb!!

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horse and having a mounting block sure make setting and resetting fence much easier. I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!). So, missing my block, I ordered this one. At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it. What I like: Stability. I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block ha a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily. I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over. The step themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them. The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which make the block easier to pick up. While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort. What I don't like: I wish it were about 2"" taller. Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photo on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back. And finally, the step are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step. This mean the mounting block collect water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm. I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself).",1,4

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Paid 206 dollar for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon. I actually bought two of them. For the price they deserve 5 star but they were not perfect. They came boxed nicely with lot of foam but the top and bottom piece of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner. Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which mean someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there wa one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units. I wa able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the hole to hold them together. Also, that same hole on one unit wa too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter. It took u almost 4 hour to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tool and getting all the part out of the box. We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these. The back are made of wood panel and slat and look good from behind, the drawer glide nice and the magnet on the cabinet door are strong.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I have no doubt that this is an amazing showerhead. I wa confident in this when I got this showerhead because I have other Grohe fixture in my home, and they are awesome. So, I have every confidence in the quality of this fixture. My problem with it is that while it say ""retro-fit,"" which would seem to indicate that it can be retrofitted to just about any shower out there, assuming that the shower ha enough room to fit the unit, which mine did. The problem (for me, anyway) is that the fixture is so heavy, it need to be anchored into the wall with huge screw both on the top of the unit and the bottom. So, you have to have the structure inside the wall of your shower in order to have something to anchor those screw into. I happen to have an older home, and while my shower wa re-done recently, (not by me), the structural integrity just isn't there. Luckily, the plumber I hired to put this unit in, realized this before he got too far into it. So, the bottom line is that, again, while this is a ""retro-fit"" showerhead, it will not work for every shower, and you need to be very careful to know whether or not your shower can work with this unit...not just in term of size, but in term of structural integrity inside the walls...before you buy it. I wa unable to install this unit, but I'm still giving this a four star rating. Why? Just based on my previous experience with Grohe products...knowing how great the quality is with this company. I also thoroughly inspected all the part of this when the plumber opened the package, and all part for this are heavy, well made, and high-quality. I'm keeping this unit because I plan to re-do my bathroom one day soon, and I am definitely going to use this once I do.",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book. I have to say I wa surprised that my attention wa caught from the get go. It wa very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 year buried at sea. When he wa 'resurrected' he wa thrown into the future and struggled to catch up. His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in. A few thing bugged me about this story. The grammatical errors. When Dom accused Palo a a 'trader'. I think the word should have been 'traitor'. So little thing like that distracted me from the story a bit. The author glossed over the transition period for Dom. I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century. I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth. The sex described seemed to skip a few steps. I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there wa no writing direction, the reader ha to assume what happens and where the position of the character are. There were instance where I had to re read passage to see if I missed some things. In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker. The only lady he showed an interest in wa a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of! So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"5 star for customer service! Like many other reviewer on this product, the battery from Anker last about 7-8 month before the battery start to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drain out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pic of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all company were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat. Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and it basically been hanging onto it electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 month with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this wa the way to go for me, especially with the warranty.

I gave it 3 star because there were a few thing wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemish on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted wa bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller. All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec wa in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i wa mistaken. I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which wa partially destroyed upon opening the box. Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

I'd say this light bulb is a very bright light bulb and it's pretty strong. I like that it's not too yellowish to look at but I'd be happy with it if it had a bright white light.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com I normally enjoy story that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eye of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that. Fearlessly written, the author hold absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thought is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this wa fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author doe with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world. The story is graphic, and many of the scene are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crime such a this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of u would like to believe. It often read more like a diary, where the killer tell a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It wa a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished a there is definitely more to be told here. I recommend this for anyone who think they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",1,4

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begin with a foreword by the author in which she outline each of the stories, most of which take place on world of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the culture may be, however strange their societal structure and customs, Ms. Le Guin us each tale to underscore what truly unites u and make u human. These story comprise the first two-thirds of the book. As much a I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the world of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves character who have lived their entire life in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via film and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own ritual and custom with which they structure their life until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonist who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notion of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at it destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and it destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tear to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common a human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world.",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This wa a very captivating and enjoyable novel. Young take u back to Old Town and Haymakers for one exciting and emotionally provocative tale. Her vivid description and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters. Youngs writing style make you feel like you're sitting beside the character listening to the story instead of reading it. This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down. I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better. Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her make it so much more real. I feel like I understand Harley now. Seeing what she think and learning her history make her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know. Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing. I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now. The contrast between the way the two main character see themselves a compared to how they see each other definitely add to the story. As a whole, this wa a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely. Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brother saga, but it wa a fantastic journey while it lasted.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So I like big desk with lot of spot to organize your thing on. My wife hated my previous desk, which wa big with lot of organizing space. She thought it wa ugly, but it wa the only desk I could find that suited my need in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set. It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional detail and style this desk offer you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk ha some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cable to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that end next to hole in the side board for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords. The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried a good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need. This credenza wa used a an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same a this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on it own it make for a good, solid worktable.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begin with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for book of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, caution his son that he must never speak of what he see to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be it protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catch his eye. He devours the book, but when he try to find more book by Carax, he discovers that someone ha mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest book he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who ha been attempting to obliterate Carax's work from the literary landscape. Daniel feel compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begin to eerily mimic event in Carax's life. The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sound like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commute so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employ mood music. On the one hand, the music wa a cue to listen carefully a something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do a I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it take twist and turns. However, Zafn brought the street of Barcelona alive. Anyone who love book should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind.",1,4
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode make this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse. Animation studio with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly ha enough cash after success like the Spiderman and X-Men films. Though they tried to put in element from the brilliantly developed character in the Ultimates comic series, each scene wa rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement. That, combined with chunky animation, leaf you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters. The animation of Giant Man's growth wa unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking. Wasp's growth, having her wing disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown show a ridiculously poor understanding by the animator and director of how her power is supposed to work. Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film. Each segue wa hard and roughly paced. Camera angle were sharp and character badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized. Scenes were poorly framed. Character dialogue wa unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top. The best voice actor in the film wa Andre Ware a Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here. Marvel studio haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation. I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these character on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it. JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality. Step up to the plate, Marvel. Play time's over.",0,4

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while. But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended period because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the review and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot... Sturdiness: I real the instruction and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animal can get around that ... oh well. Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It wa easy. To test it, I put 5 cup in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding. Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes release 1/4 le the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time. Sound: I wa testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard wa the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all. I am going to set the other one up and test them a few time and I'll update my review. So far so good... Update: So I've had it a couple day now and it is dispensing what it say it will. Again, the only it make is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase.",1,4

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced. I'm also glad that Kip Pardue ha disappeared from film, since his presence wa an ink stain on anything he graced. He is just so dull. This flick doesn't do him any favors. Sure, the racing sequence are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars. The remainder of the cast is also a mess. Estella Warren make a pretty bland romantic interest. She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull. Sylvester Stallone ha never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmer of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick. Instead, he grumble through this film a if he wa merely tolerating it. The only shimmer of light come from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character. In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission. This is easily one of the worst film 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesty a `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'.",0,4

As a small shop owner, I found much information in this book useful even though I am not a restauranteur, and have referred to it often over the past year and some month I've had it. I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feel their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger point he is making re: business. It ha helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamental of my business, including challenging my own bias and preconception about my shop. The only reason my review is not 5 star is that it doe repeat itself a bit at the end. This is also the fault of a great many business books, most of which do this to a much greater degree.",1,4
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Unfolding like a thriller, Winged Obsession recount the dogged effort of U.S. Fish and Game agent Ed Newcomer to lasso his man, Yoshi Kojiyama, a Japanese butterfly smuggler who fancy himself the ""Indiana Jones of butterfly smuggling."" You could not make up a character like Yoshi. His personality is truly unique and could only exist in real life. A fictional person such a he would be laughed off the page. This book is so rich, filled with so many fascinating elements, and from the very beginning, the reader know he will not be able to put it down. Jessica Speart is an unusual combination of nature enthusiast expert and mystery writer, which make the varying element of her story hang together so well. The reader not only get much information about butterfly and beetles, and the black market world behind their collection, but also a ripping good story about a heroic agent who won't stop until he get his man, no matter what it takes. Included is a description of his case against pigeon breeder that is totally apart from the central narrative and could support an entire book on it own. This is also an entire treatise on the nature of obsession and the need to own the rare, the exotic, the item on the verge of extinction. ""The rarer the more unusual, the fewer, and the weirder something is, the more it's in demand by people in the trade."" There will be understandable comparison to The Orchid Thief, but Winged Obsession is better written, more accessible, funnier and scarier than that one.",1,4

Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It put off ton of light. I wa really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon a I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on a long a there is motion in front of it.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect ""huggable"" size for my 1 year old. The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one ha a different tactile response. The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animal to the pelican. The child ha to really push the animal in, because the toy tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills. The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animal will just fall out on their own. In fact, while my 2 year old twin enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animal straight into the pelican's belly. There is also tie on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rail or a play yard - at least according to the directions. Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rail of a crib, because by the time a child reach the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used a a step. However, we keep it in the toy box, and it get played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy.",1,4

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Joyce's ""Dubliners"" is a collection of fifteen short story that present snapshot of the life of common people in Dublin around the beginning of the 20th Century. The story are subtle commentary about Irish attitude towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death. Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such a sexual perversion (""An Encounter""), infatuation (""Araby""), the frustration of personal unfulfillment (""A Little Cloud"" and ""Counterparts""), self-imposed loneliness (""A Painful Case""), hubris (""A Mother""), and Catholic/Protestant conflict (""Grace""). Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance, and piety permeate all the stories. The story are neither depressing nor uplifting, but rather open-ended in their denouement; no conflict are resolved and no moral conclusion are reached. Joyce depicts the character and scene so sympathetically that the reader understands clearly why the dejected boy in ""Araby"" leaf the bazaar feeling like ""a creature driven and derided by vanity"" and the event that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of ""Counterparts."" And why, in ""The Dead,"" Gabriel, after giving a dinner speech in which he make respectful reference to the dead, feel his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the tragic fate of her past love. After nearly a century, ""Dubliners"" remains one of the best crystallization of humanity bestowed upon the world.",1,4

With most dropper post running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike wa only around $900. I did ton of research, read lot of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper. So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawback to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offer (100mm compared to many dropper with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just ha a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer history I've read in the past. I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many character in the space without rounding the character out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personality and not enough color given to their backgrounds. I feel the author's past a a journalist ha influenced her here. She can write volume of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup. This tea ball easily hold a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal tea suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fit snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything clean up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner. I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product.

They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period wa required. I stomped through the mud and water and my sock stayed nice and dry. I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knee and foot felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It is definitely not a big and strong a the industrial cage you find at the gym, but it perfect for a workout room or basement at home. The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it. If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slide backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches. It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall. But the primary reason for only 3 star is the bench. The base of the bench is a T shape. This is great if you are laying back a the leg the jet out provide support. But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail. It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all. After two month I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench wa of higher quality. The seat portion of the bench ha 3 setting to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart. The entire seat barely incline an inch. When incline benching it hard to fight the sensation that your body want to slide down the bench. Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing. It take some force. And finally, the wheel on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible. I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheel to hit the ground. My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels. She practically ha to lift the end above her head. We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat. The cage is great though, it everything I needed for a basement workout area.",0,4
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlight at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which work good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it default to the second brightest setting which make sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun come up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorist (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change level you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this us a opposed to the mount other light use. In fact that wa a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long a you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it run out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove. The light feel solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.",1,4

The ipad rest in the closed position on top of the keyboard. It easily slide off, but more often, it move just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery. At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on. It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed. Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh. If you can manage keeping it closed (or completely turn off the ipad each time) the keyboard work well. Thats it.",0,4

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that take about 30 minute (give or take depending on experience and number of players). In this game, each player take control of a bos from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure hero into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room card to build the dungeon, and Spell card to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the hero and collect them a ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the hero will break through and wound you. Any bos who take five wound is killed and out of the game. But the first bos to survive and gain ten soul is the winner. This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just scream ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video game and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game. It doe have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and doe not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of u were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable. However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more.

A+ I read direction in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 time and ran it until air wa out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading review about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentleman on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hour splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chip to stick to it. And it help to prevent screeching sounds.

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"The usual problem with reviewing cat toy is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cat a a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat doe not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture. Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owner or their pet will have much use for it. First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cat and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cat will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this a furniture. As a scratching post (and also a a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, a it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching post that move around a they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for. My cat tried this once a a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor a she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and ha not returned to it since. Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designer of this product ignored these axiom and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is. Two stars, because your cat might like it a a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily.",0,4
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"It's a fairly entertaining game. It take about 5 minute to explain the rules, and about 30 to play. The rule are simple and there is a little amount of hidden role to keep people guessing. The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo. 4 star because some character card have more of an impact than others. Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win. Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the player are Outlaws). I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other game that fill this particular itch better. I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns. There are other game that I think can fill this void better, such a One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple. But if those game aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group. You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the game previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden role action mechanic in a game. 7/10 would recommend.",1,4

As far a sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eye or bumping ugli like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing le than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there. Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural. Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline wa good but too much wa happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario wa thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situation needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

The reader could constantly feel that the author wa 'talking down' to them. Many of the scenario and occurrence are truly laughable (laugh-out-aloud laughable) in their improbability.....

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I had read some review saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup size UP and it wa still too small! Definitely along the line of a sport bra squish effect. The side do come up high. Glamorise is one the best brand for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one. The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasp to do up. What a pain. I think if I had ordered 3 size up it might be ok. I won't return it a I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road. Will update review at that time. If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good. UPDATE: After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras. I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it. Initially, because it wa so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either. As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra. Due to it elastic nature I wa able to adjust this for comfort more than the others. After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost it initial snugness and wa in fact VERY comfortable! 5 week after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate. The number of clasp in the front turned out to be a bonus a well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasp undone, adding to the comfort level. I am still of the opinion that it run too snug and I'm glad I ordered up. Take the time to break the bra in! All bra have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different. I'm actually quite happy with it now.",1,4

They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feel great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.

The ankle feel like it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoe or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clip on the interior side of the calf are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comment have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your foot slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clip are not so large a to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement. After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn a dress shoe or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;) Overall, I like them and would recommend them.",1,4

The prose is beautiful, and really place you the moment. It wa particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scene wa a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This wa not good v evil, it wa just two people who happened to be on two different side of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII. My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapter are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax.

Then after a couple week listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and wa dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound wa no longer special. These are much more comfortable and the ear cup are larger to fit my whole ear. Back to the noise cancellation - it work like this: you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume. The train arrives and you hop on. The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversation around. However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sound just a good. You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are! I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I wa looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who star in this story for much more than her beauty wa perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man say he love you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he say it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story wa the strong female friendship that are too seldom found in literature. This story wa well written and the story flowed well. The imagery wa exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story wa Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feeling for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four star instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that make you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one.",1,4

This mean le strain for me and my limb every time we take a walk. Previously, I used neck collar and harness where the leash ring wa on my dog's back. Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I wa choking him. I think the latter made him feel like he wa in control of the walk and not me. CON: The harness ha to be tightened in the appropriate area (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not a effective.

I like how the comment is just ""sorry""..... why wouldn't the organization try to make it right? Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"". Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"". Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke. And you can be sure I will share this story with everyone I can...... Original Review: Well I have had this camera for 1.5 year and have to say it take amazing pictures. It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brand and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere. Fits well into small bags, purse etc Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one..... There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... ha been a nightmare...... sigh!! I wasted ton of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size. Tried a few camera store and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded.... That mean I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap. What a ""post-purchase"" drag this ha been! Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brand now that have more main stream camera part so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle...... You've lost all my future business on this Sony.....",0,4

Many people found them sexually suggestive. I found them exploitive but not really offensive. Mann spends time defending herself on the photo calling herself nave time and time again. That's OK for awhile but it get tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all. She is shocked that pedophile are interested in them. Really? She also separate the picture from the children. She say the child are merely actor in the picture and can keep the two separate identity apart even the 6 year old. Then she go on to say how nice it is to have picture of their childhood. Which is it? Are they separate or true depictions? After that she go on to explore past relations. She discus her husband's parent murder/suicide.

(Apparently, there are also several others featuring the same group of friend and family which Higgins ha dubbed, The Blue Heron Series.) Not quite a sharp a the Best Man, it did follow a similar path, with stubbornly single bar owner Colleen, who love to set up everyone else, but resists falling in love herself after being badly burned by a former flame. And guess who happens to show up in Colleens bar one day? Yep, the one that got away, Lucas. This isn't groundbreaking, and it get to same destination a youd expect from a romance title, but Higgins doe it with a lot more panache than your average rote, romance author. Witty dialogue, cliche-free conversation and a healthy dose of snark, all combined with a still sweet and, well, romantic romance.

I find taking picture indoors without the flash superior than with it on. 4. The camera is very sensitive to shake during still...and the image stabalizer only work for movies. This really need a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruin the image, particularly in zoom. 5. It is true you can take a still while recording a movie. However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sound of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio I love the camera for convenience and remarkable capability.

Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) ha ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he ha the same one a the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He doe have accessories: interchangeable hand (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumb up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figure is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figure have amazing detail.

They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it wa because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter box downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cat used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter wa used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box wa use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clump in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the position of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) wa used all day. The clay litter box wa clean! Both upstairs clay litter box were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cat standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box wa being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY.

In all other respects, I thought the editorial review are pretty good summary of what you will find in this book. It could have been better edited. Despite it chronological organization, there are a surprising number of place where a person or event who ha died earlier in the book pop up again. For instance, after the chapter on Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one move to a chapter that begin with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again. Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily. The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits reference too often. Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, a one would expect from an art critic. But there are only two set of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the image and sight described by the author. I often wanted to be able to compare his description to photograph of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the cover of the book.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but doe not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all. There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch. The mount: The rail mount need probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 groove or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also ha a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail. Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional. This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.",1,4

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,Absolutely amazing!! This book is my favorite read of 2015! S Moose did an amazing job of pulling you in and once I started I could not put this book down. Treston and Zara brought out all kind of emotion from wanting to hug them to wanting to strangle them. I highly recommend this book and would give it 10 star if I could!!!,1,3

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast ha woven it spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, a well a being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trial and tribulation they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons. The third season, in my opinion, is what really shine out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arc completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best a Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what make people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met. You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell get a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly doe NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in place that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episode I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills. Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child get distressed. A couple plot element have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode.",1,4
